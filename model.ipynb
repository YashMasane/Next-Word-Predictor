arthur conan doyle were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind he the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position he never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer they were admirable things for the observerexcellent for drawing the veil from mens motives and actions but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own highpower lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his and adler of dubious and questionable memory from each other my own complete happiness and the homecentred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention while holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in baker street buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature he was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police summons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland beyond these signs of door which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and keen desire to see holmes again and to know how he was employing his against the blind he was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him to me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story he was at work again he had risen out of his drugcreated and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own to see me with hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion that you intended to go into harness then how do you know yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl jane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but there he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant bootslitting specimen of the london slavey as to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his tophat to show where pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your believe that my eyes are as good as yours quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair you see but you do not observe the distinction is clear for example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room how often well some hundreds of times then how many are there quite so you have not observed and yet you have seen that is just both seen and observed by the way since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you may be interested in this he threw over a sheet of thick pinktinted notepaper which had been lying open the note was undated and without either signature or address there will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eight oclock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated this account of you we have from all quarters received be in your chamber then at that hour and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask theories to suit facts but the note itself what do you deduce from endeavouring to imitate my companions processes such paper could not paper at all hold it up to the light with a small t woven into the texture of the paper what do you make of that asked holmes the name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather not at all the g with the small t stands for gesellschaft our co p of course stands for papier now for the eg let us glance at our continental gazetteer he took down a heavy brown volume germanspeaking countryin bohemia not far from carlsbad remarkable as being the scene of the death of wallenstein and for its numerous glassfactories and papermills ha ha my boy what do you make of that his eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette precisely and the man who wrote the note is a german do you note the peculiar construction of the sentencethis account of you we have from all quarters received a frenchman or russian could not have written remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and grating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the bell holmes a pair by the sound said he yes he continued glancing out of the window a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties a hundred and fifty guineas apiece theres money in this case watson if there is nothing else but your client sit down in that armchair doctor and give us your best attention a slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage paused immediately outside the door then there was a loud and authoritative tap come in said holmes a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height with the chest and limbs of a hercules his dress was rich with a richness which would in england be looked upon as akin to bad taste heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his doublebreasted coat while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flamecoloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl boots which extended halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance he carried a broadbrimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upper part of his face extending down past the cheekbones a black vizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered from the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character with a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy you had my note he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly one to the other of us as if uncertain which to address pray take a seat said holmes this is my friend and colleague dr watson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases whom understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour and gentleman anything which you may say to me by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european history you will excuse this mask continued our strange visitor the august not exactly my own the circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe to speak plainly the matter implicates the great house of ormstein hereditary kings of bohemia his armchair and closing his eyes our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client should be better able to advise you the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation then with a gesture of desperation he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground you are right ormstein grand duke of casselfelstein and hereditary king of but you can understand said our strange visitor sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead you can from prague for the purpose of consulting you then pray consult said holmes shutting his eyes once more the facts are briefly these some five years ago during a lengthy kindly look her up in my index doctor murmured holmes without opening his eyes for many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staffcommander who had written a monograph upon the deepsea fishes let me see said holmes hum born in new jersey in the year retired from operatic stageha living in londonquite so your wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back precisely so but how was there a secret marriage no legal papers or certificates produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is she to prove their authenticity there is the writing pooh pooh forgery my private notepaper my own seal my photograph we were both in the photograph oh dear that is very bad your majesty has indeed committed an you have compromised yourself seriously we have tried and failed she will not sell stolen then five attempts have been made twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house once we diverted her luggage when she travelled twice she has been waylaid there has been no result no sign of it absolutely none but a very serious one to me returned the king reproachfully to ruin me but how to clotilde lothman von saxemeningen second daughter of the king of scandinavia you may know the strict principles of her family she is herself the very soul of delicacy a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end she will do it you do not know her but she has a soul of steel she has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most lengths to which she would not gonone you are sure that she has not sent it yet and why because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed that will be next monday oh then we have three days yet said holmes with a yawn that is just at present your majesty will of course stay in london for the certainly you will find me at the langham under the name of the count then as to money you have carte blanche have that photograph and for present expenses the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes he holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook and handed it to him and mademoiselles address he asked holmes took a note of it one other question said he was the photograph a cabinet some good news for you and goodnight watson he added as the to chat this little matter over with you yet returned the landlady informed me that he had left the house however with the intention of awaiting him however long he might be surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a investigation which my friend had on hand there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation and his keen incisive reasoning which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work and to follow the quick subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head groom illkempt and sidewhiskered with an inflamed face and vanished into the bedroom whence he emerged in five minutes tweedsuited and respectable as of old putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes well really he cried and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back limp and helpless in the chair what is it character of a groom out of work there is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men be one of them and you will know all villa with a garden at the back but built out in front right up to the road two stories chubb lock to the door large sittingroom on the right side well furnished with long windows almost to the floor and those preposterous english window fasteners which a child could open behind there was nothing remarkable save that the passage window examined it closely from every point of view but without noting anything else of interest the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses and received in exchange twopence a glass of halfandhalf two fills of shag tobacco listen to oh she has turned all the mens heads down in that part she is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet so say the serpentinemews to a man she lives quietly sings at concerts drives out at five every day and returns at seven sharp for dinner seldom goes out at other times except when she sings has only one male visitor but a good deal of him he is dark handsome and dashing never calls less than once a day and often twice he is a mr godfrey confidant they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentinemews began to walk up and down near briony lodge once more and to think over my plan of campaign this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter he was a lawyer that sounded ominous what was the relation between them and what the object of his repeated visits was she his client continue my work at briony lodge or turn my attention to the to understand the situation to briony lodge and a gentleman sprang out he was a remarkably handsome man dark aquiline and moustachedevidently the man of whom to wait and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home him in the windows of the sittingroom pacing up and down talking he emerged looking even more flurried than before as he stepped up to the cab he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly drive like the devil he shouted first to gross hankeys in regent street and then to the church of st monica in the edgeware road half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau the coachman with his coat only halfbuttoned and his tie under his ear while all caught a glimpse of her at the moment but she was a lovely woman with a face that a man might die for the church of st monica john she cried and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes cab came through the street the driver looked twice at such a shabby clear enough what was in the wind were there before us the cab and the landau with their steaming horses followed and a surpliced clergyman who seemed to be expostulating with lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church suddenly to my surprise the three at the altar faced round to me and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me thank god he cried youll do come come come man come only three minutes or it wont be legal found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear and thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other while the informality about their license that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion pair might take an immediate departure and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part at the church door however they shall drive out in the park at five as usual she said as she left went off to make my own arrangements which are you dont mind breaking the law not in the least nor running a chance of arrest not in a good cause oh the cause is excellent but what is it you wish now he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our seven we must be at briony lodge to meet her and what then come what may you understand to do nothing whatever there will probably be some small into the house four or five minutes afterwards the sittingroom window will open you are to station yourself close to that open window you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of fire you quite follow me with a cap at either end to make it selflighting your task is confined to that when you raise your cry of fire it will be taken up by quite a number of people you may then walk to the end of the myself clear the signal to throw in this object then to raise the cry of fire and to wait you at the corner of the street then you may entirely rely on me he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simpleminded nonconformist clergyman his broad black hat his baggy trousers his white tie his sympathetic smile and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such holmes changed his costume his expression his manner his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed the stage lost a fine actor even as science lost an acute reasoner when he became a specialist in crime wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine we paced up and down in front of briony lodge waiting for the coming sherlock holmes succinct description but the locality appeared to be quiet neighbourhood it was remarkably animated there was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner a scissorsgrinder with his wheel two guardsmen who were flirting with a nursegirl and several welldressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths you see remarked holmes as we paced to and fro in front of the house this marriage rather simplifies matters the photograph becomes a doubleedged weapon now the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr godfrey norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess now the question is where are we to find the photograph where indeed size too large for easy concealment about a womans dress she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched two attempts of the sort have already been made we may take it then that she does not carry it about with her where then inclined to think neither women are naturally secretive and they like to do their own secreting why should she hand it over to anyone else she could trust her own guardianship but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man besides remember that she had resolved to use it within in her own house but it has twice been burgled pshaw they did not know how to look but how will you look what then but she will refuse carriage now carry out my orders to the letter as he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the the door of briony lodge as it pulled up one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper but was elbowed away by another loafer who had rushed up with the same intention a fierce quarrel broke out which was increased by the two guardsmen who took sides with one of the loungers and by the scissorsgrinder who was equally hot upon the other side a blow was struck and in an instant the lady who had stepped from her carriage was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground with the blood running freely down his face at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other while a number of better dressed people who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall looking back into the street he is dead cried several voices no no theres life in him shouted another but hell be gone before you can get him to hospital hes a brave fellow said a woman they would have had the ladys purse and watch if it hadnt been for him they were a gang and a rough one too ah hes breathing now he cant lie in the street may we bring him in marm surely bring him into the sittingroom there is a comfortable sofa this way please slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out in the the window the lamps had been lit but the blinds had not been drawn whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was conspiring or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man and yet it would be the blackest treachery to holmes thought we are not injuring her we are but preventing her from injuring another is in need of air a maid rushed across and threw open the window at rocket into the room with a cry of fire the word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators well dressed and illgentlemen ostlers and servant maidsjoined in a general shriek of fire thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false of the street and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friends arm in mine and to get away from the scene of uproar he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the edgeware road you did it very nicely doctor he remarked nothing could have been you have the photograph and how did you find out perfectly simple you of course saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice they were all engaged for the evening then they carried me in she was bound to have me in what else could compelled to open the window and you had your chance how did that help you was of use to me and also in the arnsworth castle business a married woman grabs at her baby an unmarried one reaches for her jewelbox now it was clear to me that our lady of today had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of she would rush to secure it the alarm of fire was admirably done the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel she responded beautifully the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right but the coachman had come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait a little overprecipitance may ruin all tomorrow and with you if you care to come with us we will be shown into the sittingroom to wait for the lady but it is probable that a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands and when will you call at eight in the morning she will not be up so that we shall have a clear field besides we must be prompt for this marriage may mean a we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door he was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said goodnight mister sherlock holmes there were several people on the pavement at the time but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the you have really got it he cried grasping sherlock holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face not yet but you have hopes we must have a cab no my brougham is waiting then that will simplify matters we descended and started off once more for briony lodge married when but to whom to an english lawyer named norton but she could not love him and why in hopes not love your majesty there is no reason why she should interfere with your majestys plan what a queen she would have made he relapsed into a moody silence which was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenue the door of briony lodge was open and an elderly woman stood upon the steps she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the questioning and rather startled gaze this morning with her husband by the train from charing cross for the continent what sherlock holmes staggered back white with chagrin and surprise do you mean that she has left england never to return and the papers asked the king hoarsely all is lost we shall see he pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawingroom followed by the king and myself the furniture was scattered about in every direction with dismantled shelves and open drawers as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight holmes rushed at the bellpull tore back a small sliding shutter and plunging in his hand pulled out a photograph and a letter the superscribed to sherlock holmes esq to be left till called for my midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way my dear mr sherlock holmesyou really did it very well you took been told that if the king employed an agent it would certainly be you and your address had been given me yet with all this you down just as you departed really an object of interest to the celebrated mr sherlock holmes the temple to see my husband we both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by so formidable an antagonist so you will find the nest empty when you call tomorrow as to the photograph your client may rest in what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might what a womanoh what a woman cried the king of bohemia when we had that she was not on my level successful conclusion on the contrary my dear sir cried the king nothing could be more safe as if it were in the fire you this ring he slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand said holmes you have but to name it this photograph the king stared at him in amazement turning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched out to him he set off in my company for his chambers and that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of bohemia and how the best plans of mr sherlock holmes were beaten by a when he refers to her photograph it is always under the honourable title of the woman autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout floridfaced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair with an me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me you could not possibly have come at a better time my dear watson he said cordially not at all this gentleman mr wilson has been my partner and helper be of the utmost use to me in yours also the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting with a quick little questioning glance from his small fatencircled eyes try the settee said holmes relapsing into his armchair and putting know my dear watson that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle and if you will excuse my saying so somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself which is always far more daring than any effort of the you did doctor but none the less you must come round to my view for reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right now mr jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed present case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events perhaps mr wilson you would have the great kindness to recommence not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips as admit that the facts are to the best of my belief unique the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat as he glanced down the advertisement column with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee companion to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman obese pompous and slow he wore rather baggy grey shepherds check trousers a not overclean black frockcoat unbuttoned in the front and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament a frayed tophat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him save his blazing red head and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features sherlock holmes quick eye took in my occupation and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour that he takes snuff that he is a freemason that he has been in china and that he has done mr jabez wilson started up in his chair with his forefinger upon the paper but his eyes upon my companion how in the name of goodfortune did you know all that mr holmes your hands my dear sir your right hand is quite a size larger than your left you have worked with it and the muscles are more well the snuff then and the freemasonry especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you use an arcandcompass breastpin what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk well but china the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject that trick of staining the fishes scales of a delicate pink is quite your watchchain the matter becomes even more simple nothing in it after all explaining omne ignotum pro magnifico you know and my poor candid can you not find the advertisement mr wilson halfway down the column here it is this is what began it all you just read it for yourself sir to the redheaded league on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins of lebanon pennsylvania usa there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of a week for purely nominal services all redheaded men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twentyone years are eligible apply in person on monday at eleven oclock to duncan ross at the offices of the league popes court fleet street over the extraordinary announcement holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit when in and now mr wilson off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself your household and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes you will first make a note doctor of the paper and the date would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business what is the name of this obliging youth asked sherlock holmes put ideas in his head why indeed you seem most fortunate in having an employ who comes remarkable as your advertisement oh he has his faults too said mr wilson never was such a fellow for photography snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures that is his main fault but on the whole hes a good worker theres no vice in him yes sir he and a girl of fourteen who does a bit of simple cooking widower and never had any family we live very quietly sir the three of us and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts if we do nothing more the first thing that put us out was that advertisement spaulding he came down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand and he says why says he heres another vacancy on the league of the so that the trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money ready for me to step into stayathome man and as my business came to me instead of my having to have you never heard of the league of the redheaded men he asked with his eyes open oh merely a couple of hundred a year but the work is slight and it need not interfere very much with ones other occupations well you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears for the business has not been over good for some years and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy well said he showing me the advertisement you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy and there is the address where was founded by an american millionaire ezekiah hopkins who was very peculiar in his ways he was himself redheaded and he had a great sympathy for all redheaded men so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to and very little to do not so many as you might think he answered you see it is really confined to londoners and to grown men this american had started from london when he was young and he wanted to do the old town a good turn light red or dark red or anything but real bright blazing fiery red now if you cared to apply mr wilson you would just walk in but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds now it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselves that my hair is of a very full and rich tint so that it seemed to me that if him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me he was very willing to have a holiday so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement north south east and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement fleet street was choked with redheaded folk and popes court looked like a the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement every shade of colour they werestraw lemon orange and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up to the steps which led to the office there was a double stream upon the stair some going up in hope and some coming back dejected but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office your experience has been a most entertaining one remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff pray continue your very interesting statement there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine he said a few words to each candidate as he came up and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter after all however when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others and he closed the door as we entered so that he might have a private word with us this is mr jabez wilson said my assistant and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league and he is admirably suited for it the other answered he has every took a step backward cocked his head on one side and gazed at my hair hand and congratulated me warmly on my success sure excuse me for taking an obvious precaution with that he seized that all is as it should be but we have to be careful for we have of cobblers wax which would disgust you with human nature he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled a groan of disappointment came up from below and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a redhead to be seen except my own and that of the manager pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor are you a married man mr wilson have you a family his face fell immediately to hear you say that the fund was of course for the propagation and exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor to have the vacancy after all but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties should be able to look after that for you ten to two now a pawnbrokers business is mostly done of an evening mr holmes especially thursday and friday evening which is just before payday so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings to anything that turned up and the work what do you call purely nominal well you have to be in the office or at least in the building the will is very clear upon that point you dont comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time no excuse will avail said mr duncan ross neither sickness nor business nor anything else there you must stay or you lose your and the work volume of it in that press you must find your own ink pens and blottingpaper but we provide this table and chair will you be ready then goodbye mr jabez wilson and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to make such a will or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything started off for popes court well to my surprise and delight everything was as right as possible the table was set out ready for me and mr duncan ross was there to then he left me but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me at two oclock he bade me goodday complimented me after me this went on day after day mr holmes and on saturday the manager duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning and then after a not risk the loss of it archery and armour and architecture and attica and hoped with writings and then suddenly the whole business came to an end to an end at ten oclock but the door was shut and locked with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack here it is and you can read for yourself he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of face behind it until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter no no cried holmes shoving him back into the chair from which he most refreshingly unusual but there is if you will excuse my saying so something just a little funny about it pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door offices round but none of them seemed to know anything about it the redheaded league he said that he had never heard of any such name was new to him what the redheaded man oh said he his name was william morris he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready he moved out yesterday oh at his new offices he did tell me the address yes king edward street near st pauls manufactory of artificial kneecaps and no one in it had ever heard of either mr william morris or mr duncan ross and what did you do then asked holmes assistant but he could not help me in any way he could only say that and you did very wisely said holmes your case is an exceedingly it than might at first sight appear see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league on nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter a you have lost nothing by them was a pretty expensive joke for them for it cost them two and thirty we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you and first one or two questions mr wilson this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisementhow long had he been with you about a month then how did he come was he the only applicant why did you pick him because he was handy and would come cheap at half wages in fact small stoutbuilt very quick in his ways no hair on his face though hes not short of thirty has a white splash of acid upon his much said he have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for yes sir he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a hum said holmes sinking back in deep thought he is still with and has your business been attended to in your absence nothing to complain of sir theres never very much to do of a hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion well watson said holmes when our visitor had left us what do you make of it all as a rule said holmes the more bizarre a thing is the less which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face is the most that you wont speak to me for fifty minutes he curled himself up in his chair with his thin knees drawn up to his hawklike nose and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out he had dropped asleep and indeed was nodding myself when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece sarasate plays at the st jamess hall this afternoon he remarked what do you think watson could your patients spare you for a few of german music on the programme which is rather more to my taste than we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate and a short walk took us to saxecoburg square the scene of the singular story which we place where four lines of dingy twostoried brick houses looked out into a small railedin enclosure where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smokeladen and uncongenial atmosphere three gilt balls and a brown board with place where our redheaded client carried on his business sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids then he walked slowly up the street and then down again to the corner still looking keenly at the houses finally he returned to the pawnbrokers and having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or opened by a brightlooking cleanshaven young fellow who asked him to step in from here to the strand third right fourth left answered the assistant promptly closing the door smart fellow that observed holmes as we walked away he is in my way merely in order that you might see him not him what then the knees of his trousers and what did you see why did you beat the pavement my dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk we are spies in an enemys country we know something of saxecoburg square let us now explore the parts which lie behind it the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxecoburg square presented as great a contrast to it as arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward while the footpaths were black with looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted let me see said holmes standing at the corner and glancing along mortimers the tobacconist the little newspaper shop the coburg mcfarlanes carriagebuilding depot that carries us right on to the other block and now doctor weve done our work so its time we had some play a sandwich and a cup of coffee and then off to violinland where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony and there are no redheaded clients to vex us with their conundrums my friend was an enthusiastic musician being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuthhound holmes the relentless keenwitted singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself and his the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him the swing of his nature took him from so truly formidable as when for days on end he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his blackletter editions then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other he had set himself to hunt down you want to go home no doubt doctor he remarked as we emerged yes it would be as well business at coburg square is serious why serious believe that we shall be in time to stop it but today being saturday at what time ten will be early enough kindly put your army revolver in your pocket he waved his hand turned on his heel and disappeared in an instant among the crowd oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock seen and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen while to me the of the redheaded copier of the encyclopdia down to the visit to saxecoburg square and the ominous words with which he had parted from that this smoothfaced pawnbrokers assistant was a formidable mana up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an across the park and so through oxford street to baker street two jones the official police agent while the other was a long thin sadfaced man with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable ha our party is complete said holmes buttoning up his peajacket know mr jones of scotland yard let me introduce you to mr merryweather who is to be our companion in tonights adventure were hunting in couples again doctor you see said jones in his consequential way our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down observed mr merryweather gloomily you may place considerable confidence in mr holmes sir said the police agent loftily he has his own little methods which are if he wont mind my saying so just a little too theoretical and fantastic that once or twice as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure he has been more nearly correct than the official oh if you say so mr jones it is all right said the stranger with a higher stake tonight than you have ever done yet and that the play will be more exciting for you mr merryweather the stake will be some and for you jones it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands john clay the murderer thief smasher and forger hes a young man rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london hes a remarkable man is young john clay his grandfather was a royal duke and he himself has been to eton and oxford his brain is as cunning as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself hell crack a crib in scotland one week and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gaslit streets until we emerged into farrington street we are close there now my friend remarked this fellow merryweather it as well to have jones with us also he is not a bad fellow though an absolute imbecile in his profession he has one positive virtue he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone here we are and they are waiting for us we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning our cabs were dismissed and following the guidance of mr merryweather we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door which he opened for us within there was a small corridor which ended in a very massive iron gate this also was opened and led down a flight of winding stone steps which terminated at another formidable gate mr merryweather stopped to light a lantern and then conducted us down a dark earthsmelling passage and so after opening a third door into a huge vault or cellar which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes you are not very vulnerable from above holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him nor from below said mr merryweather striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor why dear me it sounds quite hollow he remarked looking up in surprise severely you have already imperilled the whole success of our upon one of those boxes and not to interfere the solemn mr merryweather perched himself upon a crate with a very injured expression upon his face while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his we have at least an hour before us he remarked for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape we are at present doctoras no doubt you have divinedin the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks mr merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present warnings that an attempt might be made upon it your french gold yes we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money contains napoleons packed between layers of lead foil our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the which were very well justified observed holmes and now it is time screen over that dark lantern and sit in the dark thought that as we were a partie carre you might have your rubber that we cannot risk the presence of a light and first of all we must choose our positions these are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful fire watson have no compunction about shooting them down before experienced the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready to flash out at a moments notice to me with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the vault they have but one retreat whispered holmes that is back through asked you jones then we have stopped all the holes and now we must be silent and what a time it seemed from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us my limbs were weary and distinguish the deeper heavier inbreath of the bulky jones from the over the case in the direction of the floor suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line and then without any warning or sound a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared a white almost womanly hand which felt about in the centre of the little area of light for a minute or more the hand with its writhing fingers protruded out of the floor then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones sound one of the broad white stones turned over upon its side and left a square gaping hole through which streamed the light of a lantern over the edge there peeped a cleancut boyish face which looked keenly about it and then with a hand on either side of the aperture drew itself shoulderhigh and waisthigh until one knee hole and was hauling after him a companion lithe and small like himself with a pale face and a shock of very red hair sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar as jones clutched at his skirts the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver but holmes hunting crop came down on the mans wrist and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor there are three men waiting for him at the door said holmes compliment you youll see your pal again presently said jones hes quicker at prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists you may not be when you address me always to say sir and please all right said jones with a stare and a snigger well would you please sir march upstairs where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the policestation that is better said john clay serenely he made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective really mr holmes said mr merryweather as we followed them from there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the redheaded league you see watson he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the league and the copying of the encyclopdia must be to get this not overbright pawnbroker managing it but really it would be difficult to suggest a better the method was no doubt suggested to clays ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplices hair the a week was a lure which must draw him and what was it to them who were playing for thousands they put in the advertisement one rogue has the temporary office the other rogue incites the man to apply for it and together they manage to heard of the assistant having come for half wages it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation but how could you guess what the motive was vulgar intrigue that however was out of the question the mans business was a small one and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations and such an expenditure his trick of vanishing into the cellar the cellar there was the end daring criminals in london he was doing something in the cellarsomething which took many hours a day for months on end what running a tunnel to some other building answered it we have had some skirmishes but we had never set eyes wrinkled and stained they were they spoke of those hours of walked round the corner saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our chairman of the bank directors with the result that you have seen well when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr jabez wilsons presencein other words that they had completed their tunnel but it was essential that they should use it soon as it might be discovered or the bullion might be removed saturday would suit them better than any other day as it expected them to come tonight it closing in upon me my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence these little problems help me to do he shrugged his shoulders well perhaps after all it is of some little use he remarked lhomme cest rienluvre cest tout as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand my dear fellow said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at baker street life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent we would not dare to we could fly out of that window hand in hand hover over this great city gently remove the roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on the strange coincidences the plannings the crosspurposes the wonderful chains of events working through generations and leading to the most outr results it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable to light in the papers are as a rule bald enough and vulgar enough we have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits and yet the result is it must be confessed neither fascinating nor a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect remarked holmes this is wanting in the police report where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter depend upon it there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace to everybody who is absolutely puzzled throughout three continents you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre but know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me there is of course the other woman the drink the push the blow the bruise the sympathetic sister or landlady the crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude holmes taking the paper and glancing his eye down it this is the up some small points in connection with it the husband was a teetotaler there was no other woman and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife which you will allow is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average storyteller take a pinch of snuff doctor and acknowledge he held out his snuffbox of old gold with a great amethyst in the a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance sparkled upon his finger you who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little some ten or twelve but none which present any feature of interest field for the observation and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation the larger crimes are apt to be the simpler for the bigger the crime the more obvious as a matter which has been referred to me from marseilles there is nothing he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutraltinted london street looking over woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck and a large curling red feather in a broadbrimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish duchess of devonshire fashion over her ear from under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous hesitating fashion at our windows while her body oscillated backward and forward and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons suddenly with a plunge as of the swimmer who leaves the bank she hurried across the road and we heard the sharp clang of the bell cigarette into the fire oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de cur she would like advice but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication and yet even here we may discriminate when a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire here we may take it that there is a love matter but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed or grieved but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts as he spoke there was a tap at the door and the boy in buttons entered to announce miss mary sutherland while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a fullsailed merchantman behind a tiny pilot boat sherlock holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable and having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him do you not find he said that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting without looking then suddenly realising the full purport of his words she gave a violent start and looked up with fear and astonishment upon her broad goodhumoured face youve heard about me mr holmes she cried else how could you know all that never mind said holmes laughing it is my business to know things should you come to consult me husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up has become of mr hosmer angel why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry asked sherlock holmes with his fingertips together and his eyes to the ceiling again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mary me angry to see the easy way in which mr windibankthat is my fathertook it all he would not go to the police and he would not go to you and so at last as he would do nothing and kept on saying that and came right away to you your father said holmes your stepfather surely since the name is for he is only five years and two months older than myself and your mother is alive when she married again so soon after fathers death and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself father was a plumber in the tottenham court road and he left a tidy business behind him which mother carried on with mr hardy the foreman but when mr windibank came he made her sell the business for he was very superior being a traveller in wines they got for the goodwill and interest which wasnt near as much as father could have got if he had been inconsequential narrative but on the contrary he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention your own little income he asked does it come out of the business you interest me extremely said holmes and since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year with what you earn into the bargain you no a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about course that is only just for the time mr windibank draws my interest you have made your position very clear to me said holmes this is my friend dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself kindly tell us now all about your connection with mr hosmer a flush stole over miss sutherlands face and she picked nervously at she said they used to send father tickets when he was alive and then afterwards they remembered us and sent them to mother mr windibank did not wish us to go he never did wish us to go anywhere he would prevent he said the folk were not fit for us to know when all out of the drawer at last when nothing else would do he went off to hosmer angel france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball shrugged his shoulders and said there was no use denying anything to a woman for she would have her way gentleman called mr hosmer angel had got home all safe and after that we met himthat is to say mr again and mr hosmer angel could not come to the house any more well you know father didnt like anything of the sort he wouldnt have any visitors if he could help it and he used to say that a woman mine yet but how about mr hosmer angel did he make no attempt to see you well father was going off to france again in a week and hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone we could write in the meantime and he used to write every father to know were you engaged to the gentleman at this time oh yes mr holmes we were engaged after the first walk that we took hosmermr angelwas a cashier in an office in leadenhall what office where did he live then he slept on the premises and you dont know his address noexcept that it was leadenhall street where did you address your letters then to the leadenhall street post office to be left till called for he said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all typewrite them like he did his but he wouldnt have that for he said typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us that will just show you how fond he was of me mr holmes and the little things that he would think of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important can you remember any other little things about mr hosmer angel he was a very shy man mr holmes he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight for he said that he hated to be gentle hed had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young he told me and it had left him with a weak throat and a hesitating whispering fashion of speech he was always well dressed very neat and plain but his eyes were weak just as mine are and he wore tinted glasses against the glare well and what happened when mr windibank your stepfather returned to france mr hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back he was in dreadful earnest and made me always be true to him mother said he was quite right to make me swear and that it was a sign of his passion mother was all in his favour they both said never to mind about father but just to tell him company has its french offices but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding yes sir for he had started to england just before it arrived ha that was unfortunate your wedding was arranged then for the friday was it to be in church cross and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st pancras hotel hosmer came for us in a hansom but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a fourwheeler which happened to be the only other cab in the street we got to the church first and when the fourwheeler drove up we waited for him to step out but he never did and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him for he had seen him get in with his own anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him oh no sir he was too good and kind to leave me so why all the weddingmorning but what has happened since gives a meaning to it most certainly it does your own opinion is then that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him but you have no notion as to what it could have been one more question how did your mother take the matter and your father did you tell him yes and he seemed to think with me that something had happened and anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church and then leaving me now if he had borrowed my money or if he had married me and got my money settled on him there might be some reason but hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine and yet what could have happened and why could he not write night she pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result let the weight of the matter rest upon me now and do not let your mind dwell upon it further above all try to let mr hosmer angel vanish from your memory as he has done from your life then what has happened to him description of him and any letters of his which you can spare is the slip and here are four letters from him thank you and your address no lyon place camberwell fathers place of business he travels for westhouse marbank the great claret importers of fenchurch street thank you you have made your statement very clearly you will leave the whole incident be a sealed book and do not allow it to affect your to hosmer he shall find me ready when he comes back for all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect she laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned sherlock holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together his legs stretched out in front of him and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe which was to him as a counsellor and having lit it he leaned back in his chair with the thick blue cloudwreaths spinning up from him and a look of infinite languor in his face more interesting than her little problem which by the way is rather a trite one you will find parallel cases if you consult my index in andover in and there was something of the sort at the hague last year old as is the idea however there were one or two details which were new to me but the maiden herself was most instructive you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to not invisible but unnoticed watson you did not know where to look realise the importance of sleeves the suggestiveness of thumbnails or the great issues that may hang from a bootlace now what did you gather from that womans appearance describe it well she had a slatecoloured broadbrimmed straw hat with a feather of a brickish red her jacket was black with black beads sewn upon it and a fringe of little black jet ornaments her dress was brown rather darker than coffee colour with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves her gloves were greyish and were worn through at hanging gold earrings and a general air of being fairly welltodo in a vulgar comfortable easygoing way sherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled pon my word watson you are coming along wonderfully you have everything of importance but you have hit upon the method and you have a quick eye for colour never trust to general impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon details my first glance is always knee of the trouser as you observe this woman had plush upon her sleeves which is a most useful material for showing traces the double line a little above the wrist where the typewritist presses against the table was beautifully defined the sewingmachine of the hand type leaves a similar mark but only on the left arm and on the side of it farthest from the thumb instead of being right across the upon short sight and typewriting which seemed to surprise her on glancing down to observe that though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other they were really odd ones the one having a slightly decorated toecap and the other a plain one one was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five and the other at the first third and fifth now when you see that a young lady otherwise neatly dressed has come away from home with odd boots halfbuttoned it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a friends incisive reasoning but after being fully dressed you observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink she had written in a hurry and would not remain clear upon the finger all this is amusing though mind reading me the advertised description of mr hosmer angel the morning of the fourteenth a gentleman named hosmer angel about five ft seven in in height strongly built sallow complexion black hair a little bald in the centre bushy black sidewhiskers and moustache tinted glasses slight infirmity of speech was dressed when last seen in black frockcoat faced with silk black waistcoat gold albert chain and grey harris tweed trousers with brown gaiters over elasticsided boots known to have been employed in an office in leadenhall street anybody bringing c c that will do said holmes as to the letters he continued glancing over them they are very commonplace absolutely no clue in them to mr angel save that he quotes balzac once there is one remarkable point however which will no doubt strike you not only that but the signature is typewritten look at the neat little hosmer angel at the bottom there is a date you see but no superscription except leadenhall street which is rather vague the point about the signature is very suggestivein fact we may call it of what my dear fellow is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted should settle the matter one is to a firm in the city the other is to the young ladys stepfather mr windibank asking him whether he could we should do business with the male relatives and now doctor we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to the weird business of the sign of four and the extraordinary be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary sutherland a professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to baker street asleep with his long thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair a formidable array of bottles and testtubes with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him of the details are of interest the only drawback is that there is no who was he then and what was his object in deserting miss the question was hardly out of my mouth and holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door this is the girls stepfather mr james windibank said holmes he has written to me to say that he would be here at six come in the man who entered was a sturdy middlesized fellow some thirty years of age cleanshaven and sallowskinned with a bland insinuating manner and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes he shot a questioning glance at each of us placed his shiny tophat upon the sideboard and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair typewritten letter is from you in which you made an appointment with me for six oclock came but she is a very excitable impulsive girl as you may have noticed and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind connected with the official police but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad besides it is a useless expense for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel delighted to hear it he said quite as much individuality as a mans handwriting unless they are quite new no two of them write exactly alike some letters get more worn than others and some wear only on one side now you remark in this note of yours mr windibank that in every case there is some little slurring over of the e and a slight defect in the tail of the r there are fourteen other characteristics but those are the more we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office and no doubt it is a little worn our visitor answered glancing keenly at holmes with his bright little eyes monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man they the rs tailless but you will observe if you care to use my have alluded are there as well you can catch the man catch him and let me know when you have done certainly said holmes stepping over and turning the key in the what where shouted mr windibank turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap oh it wont doreally it wont said holmes suavely there is no and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question thats right sit down and let us talk it over our visitor collapsed into a chair with a ghastly face and a glitter windibank it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me now let me just run over the course of the man sat huddled up in his chair with his head sunk upon his breast like one who is utterly crushed holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and leaning back with his hands in his pockets began talking rather to himself as it seemed than to us the man married a woman very much older than himself for her money said he and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long was worth an effort to preserve it the daughter was of a good amiable disposition but affectionate and warmhearted in her ways so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages and her little income she would not be allowed to remain single long now her marriage would mean of course the loss of a hundred a year so what does her stepfather do to prevent it he takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age but soon he found that that would not answer forever she became restive insisted upon her rights and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball what does her clever stepfather do then he conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart with the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper and doubly secure on account of the girls short sight he appears as mr hosmer angel and keeps off other lovers by making love himself that she would have been so carried away decidedly carried away and having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in france the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind she was flattered by the gentlemans attentions and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother then mr angel began to call for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced there were meetings and an engagement which would finally secure the girls affections from turning towards anyone else but the deception could not be kept up forever these pretended journeys to france were rather cumbrous the thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young ladys mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding james windibank wished miss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel and so uncertain as to his fate that for ten years to come at any rate she would not listen to another man as far as the church door he brought her and then as he could go no farther he conveniently vanished away by the old trick think that was the chain of events mr windibank our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes had been talking and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are the first but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint the law cannot as you say touch you said holmes unlocking and throwing open the door yet there never was a man who deserved to lay a whip across your shoulders by jove he continued flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the mans face it is not whip but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs the heavy hall door banged and from the window we could see mr james windibank running at the top of his speed down the theres a coldblooded scoundrel said holmes laughing as he threw himself down into his chair once more that fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and ends on a gallows the case has in some respects been not entirely devoid of interest well of course it was obvious from the first that this mr hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident as far as we could see was the stepfather then the fact that the two men were never together but that the one always appeared when the other was away was suggestive so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice which both hinted at a disguise as did the bushy whiskers my suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature which of course inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it you see all these isolated facts together with many minor ones all pointed in the same direction and how did you verify them the firm for which this man worked having taken the printed the firm with a request that they would inform me whether it answered his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects the same post brought me a letter from westhouse marbank of fenchurch street to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employ james windibank and miss sutherland persian saying there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman there is as much sense in hafiz as in horace and as much knowledge of the world have you a couple of days to spare have just been wired for from the glad if you will come with me air and scenery perfect leave paddington by the what do you say dear said my wife looking across at me will you oh anstruther would do your work for you you have been looking a are always so interested in mr sherlock holmes cases have only half an hour my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller my wants were few and valise rattling away to paddington station sherlock holmes was pacing up and down the platform his tall gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travellingcloak and closefitting cloth cap thoroughly rely local aid is always either worthless or else biassed we had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which holmes had brought with him among these he rummaged and read with intervals of notetaking and of meditation until we were past reading then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack have you heard anything of the case he asked looking through all the recent papers in order to master the cases which are so extremely difficult that sounds a little paradoxical but it is profoundly true singularity is almost invariably a clue the more featureless and commonplace a crime is the more difficult it very serious case against the son of the murdered man understand it in a very few words herefordshire the largest landed proprietor in that part is a mr john turner who made his money in australia and returned some years ago to the old country one of the farms which he held that of hatherley was let to mr charles mccarthy who was also an exaustralian the men had known each other in the colonies so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible turner was apparently the richer man so mccarthy became his tenant but still remained it seems upon terms of perfect equality as they were frequently together mccarthy had one son a lad of eighteen and turner had an only daughter of the same age but neither of them had wives living they appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring english families and to have led retired lives though both the mccarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the racemeetings of the neighbourhood mccarthy kept two servantsa man and a girl turner had a considerable household some halfdozen at the families now for the facts on june rd that is on monday last mccarthy left his house at hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the boscombe pool which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream servingman in the morning at ross and he had told the man that he must hurry as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three from that appointment he never came back alive from hatherley farmhouse to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a mile and two people saw him as he passed over this ground one was an old woman whose name is not mentioned and the other was william crowder a gamekeeper in the employ of mr turner both these witnesses depose that mr mccarthy was walking alone the gamekeeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing mr mccarthy pass he had seen his son mr james mccarthy going the same way with a gun under his arm to the best of his belief the father was actually in sight at the time and the son was following him he thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder the gamekeeper lost sight of them the boscombe pool is thickly wooded round with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge a girl of fourteen patience moran who is the daughter of the lodgekeeper of she states that while she was there she saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake mr mccarthy and his son and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel she heard mr mccarthy the elder using very strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father she was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool and that she was afraid that they were going to fight she had hardly said the words when young mr mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodgekeeper he was much excited without either his gun or his hat and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood on following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool the head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon the injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the buttend of his sons gun which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested and a verdict of wilful murder having been returned at the inquest on tuesday he was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross who have referred the case to the next assizes those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the policecourt circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing answered holmes you shift your own point of view a little you may find it pointing in must be confessed however that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit there are several people in the neighbourhood however and among them miss turner the daughter of the neighbouring landowner who believe in his innocence and who have retained lestrade whom you may recollect in connection with the study in scarlet to work out the case in his interest lestrade being rather puzzled has referred the case to me and hence it is that two middleaged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home find little credit to be gained out of this case there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact he answered laughing besides we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to mr lestrade you know me confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing or even of understanding to take the first example to hand noted even so selfevident a thing as that how on earth characterises you you shave every morning and in this season you shave by the sunlight but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw it is surely very clear a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being observation and inference therein lies my mtier and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us there are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest and which are worth considering what are they return to hatherley farm on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it and that it was no more than his deserts this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroners jury no for it was followed by a protestation of innocence coming on the top of such a damning series of events it was at least a most suspicious remark at present see in the clouds however innocent he might be he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him had he appeared surprised at his own highly suspicious because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man or else as a man of considerable selfrestraint and firmness as to his remark about his deserts it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him and even according to the little girl whose evidence is so important to raise his hand as if to strike him the selfreproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one so they have and many men have been wrongfully hanged what is the young mans own account of the matter there are one or two points in it which are suggestive you will find it here and may read it for yourself he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had mr james mccarthy the only son of the deceased was then called and bristol and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday the rd my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival and boscombe pool with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which gamekeeper as he had stated in his evidence but he is mistaken in hurried forward and found him standing by the pool he appeared to be doing there a conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows for my father was a man of a very violent temper seeing that found my father expiring upon the ground with his head terribly my way to mr turners lodgekeeper his house being the nearest to have no idea how he came by his injuries he was not a popular man being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners but he had as far the coroner did your father make any statement to you before he died to a rat the coroner what did you understand by that the coroner what was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise between you and your father the coroner how was it then that he uttered it before he saw you and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol a juryman did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured witness nothing definite the coroner what do you mean round for it but it was gone do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help yes it was gone you cannot say what it was how far from the body a dozen yards or so and how far from the edge of the wood about the same then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of yes but with my back towards it this concluded the examination of the witness concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy he calls attention and with reason to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father and his singular account of his fathers dying words they are all as he remarks very much against the son holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat both you and the coroner have been at some pains said he to single out the very strongest points in the young mans favour dont you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little too little if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury too much if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outr as a dying reference to a rat and the incident of the view that what this young man says is true and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us and now here is my pocket petrarch and ourselves at the pretty little countrytown of ross a lean ferretlike man furtive and slylooking was waiting for us upon the difficulty in recognising lestrade of scotland yard with him we drove to the hereford arms where a room had already been engaged for us you had been on the scene of the crime entirely a question of barometric pressure lestrade laughed indulgently you have no doubt already formed your conclusions from the newspapers he said the case is as plain as a pikestaff and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes still of course one cant refuse a lady and such a very positive one too already done why bless my soul here is her carriage at the door he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most shining her lips parted a pink flush upon her cheeks all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern oh mr sherlock holmes she cried glancing from one to the other of us and finally with a womans quick intuition fastening upon my start upon your work knowing it too never let yourself doubt upon that point we have known each other since we were little children and hurt a fly such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him but you have read the evidence you have formed some conclusion do you not see some loophole some flaw do you not yourself think that he is innocent there now she cried throwing back her head and looking defiantly at lestrade you hear he gives me hopes been a little quick in forming his conclusions he said disagreements about me mr mccarthy was very anxious that there should brother and sister but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet andandwell he naturally did not wish to do anything and your father asked holmes was he in favour of such a union no he was averse to it also no one but mr mccarthy was in favour of it a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as holmes shot one of his keen questioning glances at her call tomorrow the doctor yes have you not heard poor father has never been strong for years back but this has broken him down completely he has taken to his bed and dr willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered mr mccarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the yes at the mines his money yes certainly thank you miss turner you have been of material assistance to me you will tell me if you have any news tomorrow no doubt you will go to the prison to see james oh if you do mr holmes do tell him that leave him goodbye and god help you in your undertaking she hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street minutes silence why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to have you an order to see him in prison yes but only for you and me time to take a train to hereford and see him tonight upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellowbacked novel the puny plot of the story was so thin however when compared to the it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day supposing that this unhappy young mans story were absolutely true then what hellish thing what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father and the moment when drawn back by deadly what could it be might not the nature of the injuries reveal weekly county paper which contained a verbatim account of the inquest the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been my own head clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind that was to some extent in favour of the accused as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father still it did not go for very much for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell still it might be worth while to call holmes attention to it then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat what could does not commonly become delirious no it was more likely to be an cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation and then the the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress presumably his overcoat in his flight and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off what a tissue of mysteries and could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young mccarthys innocence lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground on the other hand a man should be at his very best and keenest and what did you learn from him could he throw no light as puzzled as everyone else he is not a very quickwitted youth he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this miss ah thereby hangs a rather painful tale this fellow is madly insanely in love with her but some two years ago when he was only a lad and before he really knew her for she had been away five years at a boardingschool what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a registry office no one knows a word of the matter but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father at their last interview was goading him on to propose to miss turner on the other hand he had no means of supporting himself and his father who was by all accounts a very hard man would have thrown that he had spent the last three days in bristol and his father did come out of evil however for the barmaid finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the bermuda dockyard so that there is really no tie between that he has suffered but if he is innocent who has done it one is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool and that the someone could not have been his son for his son was away and he did not know when he would return the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry cooee before he knew that his son had returned those are the crucial points upon which the case depends and now let us talk about george meredith if you please and we shall leave all minor matters until tomorrow there was no rain as holmes had foretold and the morning broke bright and cloudless at nine oclock lestrade called for us with the carriage and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe pool that mr turner of the hall is so ill that his life is despaired of about sixty but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad and he has been in failing health for some time this business has had a very bad effect upon him he was an old friend of mccarthys gave him hatherley farm rent free here speaks of his kindness to him really does it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy who appears to have had little of his own and to have been under such obligations to turner should still talk of marrying his son to turners daughter who is presumably heiress to the estate and that in such a very cocksure manner as if it were merely a case of a know that turner himself was averse to the idea the daughter told us as much do you not deduce something from that we have got to the deductions and the inferences said lestrade flying away after theories and fancies you are right said holmes demurely you do find it very hard to tackle the facts get hold of replied lestrade with some warmth and that is that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine well moonshine is a brighter thing than fog said holmes laughing twostoried slateroofed with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls the drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys however gave it a stricken look as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it we called at the door when the maid at holmes request showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death and also a pair of the sons though not the pair which he had then had having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points holmes desired to be led to the courtyard from which we all followed the winding track which led to boscombe pool sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of baker street would have failed to recognise him his face flushed and darkened his brows were drawn into two hard black lines while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter his face was bent downward his shoulders bowed his lips compressed and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long sinewy neck his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears or at the most only provoked a quick impatient snarl in reply swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows and so by way of the district and there were marks of many feet both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side sometimes holmes would hurry on sometimes stop dead and once he made quite a little interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end the boscombe pool which is a little reedgirt sheet of water some fifty yards across is situated at the boundary between the hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr turner above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowners dwelling on the hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found and indeed so moist was face and peering eyes very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass he ran round like a dog who is picking up a scent and then turned upon my companion what did you go into the pool for he asked other trace but how on earth twist is all over the place a mole could trace it and there it been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it here is where the party with the lodgekeeper came and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body but here are three separate tracks of the same feet he drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view talking all the time rather to himself than to us these are young mccarthys feet twice he was walking and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible that bears out his story he ran when he saw his father on the ground then here are the fathers feet gun as the son stood listening and this ha ha what have we here tiptoes tiptoes square too quite unusual boots they come they go they come againof course that was for the cloak now where did they come from he ran up and down sometimes losing sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech the largest tree in the neighbourhood holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction for a long time he remained there turning over the leaves and dried sticks gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach a jagged stone was lying among the moss and this also he carefully examined and retained then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad where all traces were lost perhaps write a little note having done that we may drive back to our ross holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood this may interest you lestrade he remarked holding it out the murder was done with it there are none how do you know then with the injuries there is no sign of any other weapon and the murderer a cigarholder and carries a blunt penknife in his pocket there are several other indications but these may be enough to aid us in our theories are all very well but we have to deal with a hardheaded british jury nous verrons answered holmes calmly you work your own method probably return to london by the evening train and leave your case unfinished no finished but the mystery who was the criminal then but who is he surely it would not be difficult to find out this is not such a populous neighbourhood laughingstock of scotland yard having left lestrade at his rooms we drove to our hotel where we found lunch upon the table holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face as one who finds himself in a perplexing position look here watson he said when the cloth was cleared just sit down pray do so well now in considering this case there are two points about young mccarthys narrative which struck us both instantly although they impressed me in his favour and you against him one was the fact that his father should according to his account cry cooee before seeing him the other was his singular dying reference to a rat he mumbled several words you understand but that was all that caught the sons ear now from this double point our research must commence and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true what of this cooee then well obviously it could not have been meant for the son the son as earshot the cooee was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with but cooee is a distinctly australian cry and one which is used between australians there is a strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was someone who had been in australia what of the rat then sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it the map what do you read and now he raised his hand quite so that was the word the man uttered and of which his son only caught the last two syllables he was trying to utter the name of his murderer so and so of ballarat considerably the possession of a grey garment was a third point which granting the sons statement to be correct was a certainty we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak and one who was at home in the district for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate where strangers could hardly quite so to the personality of the criminal but how did you gain them stride his boots too might be told from their traces yes they were peculiar boots but his lameness the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left he put less weight upon it why because he limpedhe was lame but his lefthandedness you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest the blow was struck from immediately behind and yet was upon the left side now how can that be unless it were by a lefthanded man he had stood behind that tree during the the ash of a cigar which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables attention to this and written a little monograph on the ashes of different varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco having found are rolled in rotterdam and the cigarholder a holder the tip had been cut off not bitten off but the cut was not cannot escape and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if which all this points the culprit is mr john turner cried the hotel waiter opening the door of our sittingroom and ushering in a visitor the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure his slow limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude and yet his hard deeplined craggy features and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character his tangled beard grizzled hair and outstanding drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance but his face was of an ashen white while his lips and the to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic pray sit down on the sofa said holmes gently you had my note yes the lodgekeeper brought it up you said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal and why did you wish to see me he looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes as though his question was already answered mccarthy must be got off however rather die under my own roof than in a gaol holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a jot down the facts you will sign it and watson here can witness it absolutely needed been a long time in the acting but will not take me long to tell tell you that god keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he his grip has been upon me these twenty years and he has blasted my among bad companions took to drink had no luck with my claim took to the bush and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber there were six of us and we had a wild free life of it sticking up a station from time to time or stopping the wagons on the and our party is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne and we lay in wait for it and attacked it there were six troopers and six of us so it was a close thing but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley three of our boys were killed however before we got the though to remember every feature we got away with the gold became wealthy men and made our way over to england without being suspected though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path did my best to make up for the past all was going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot here we are jack says he touching me on the arm well be as good as a family to you theres two of us me and my son and you can is england and theres always a policeman within hail well down they came to the west country there was no shaking them off and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since past than of the police whatever he wanted he must have and whatever to be in weak health it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad the pool midway between our houses to talk it over listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost he was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more he had been some foul and venomous beast his cry brought back his son story gentlemen of all that occurred well it is not for me to judge you said holmes as the old man never be exposed to such a temptation your secret whether you be alive or dead shall be safe with us farewell then said the old man solemnly your own deathbeds when they come will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine tottering and shaking in all his giant frame he stumbled slowly from the room god help us said holmes after a long silence why does fate play the grace of god goes sherlock holmes james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and submitted to the defending counsel old turner lived for seven months after our interview but he is now dead and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave some however have already gained publicity through the papers and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate some too have baffled his analytical skill and would be as narratives beginnings without an ending while others have been but partially cleared up and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him there is however one of these last which was so remarkable in some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been and probably never will be entirely cleared up the year furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or paradol chamber of the amateur mendicant society who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse of the facts connected with the loss of the british barque sophy anderson of the singular adventures of the grice patersons in the island of uffa and remembered sherlock holmes was able by winding up the dead mans watch to prove that it had been wound up two hours before and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that timea deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case all these now taken up my pen to describe set in with exceptional violence all day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows so that even here in the heart of great handmade london we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation like untamed beasts in a cage as evening drew in the storm grew higher and louder and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the deep in one of clark russells fine seastories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves my wife was more in my old quarters at baker street who could come tonight some friend of yours perhaps a client then be some crony of the landladys sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture however for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door he stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit come in said he the man who entered was young some twoandtwenty at the outside wellgroomed and trimly clad with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing the streaming umbrella which he held in his hand and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber give me your coat and umbrella said holmes they may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently you have come up from the yes from horsham that is easily got and help that is not always so easy you saved him in the tankerville club scandal ah of course he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards he said that you could solve anything he said too much that you are never beaten but what is that compared with the number of your successes then you may be so with me some details as to your case ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family you fill me with interest said holmes pray give us the essential those details which seem to me to be most important the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze my name said he is john openshaw but my own affairs have as far go back to the commencement of the affair you must know that my grandfather had two sonsmy uncle elias and my father joseph my father had a small factory at coventry which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling he was a patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was a young man and became a planter in florida where he was reported to have done very well at the time of the war he fought in jacksons army and afterwards under hood where he rose to be a colonel when lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation where he remained for three or four years about or he came back to europe and took a small estate in sussex near horsham he had made a very considerable fortune in the states and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes and his dislike of the republican policy in extending the franchise to them he was a singular man fierce and quicktempered very foulmouthed when he was angry and of a most retiring ever he set foot in the town he had a garden and two or three fields round his house and there he would take his exercise though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room he drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily but he would see no society and did not want any friends not even his own brother he didnt mind me in fact he took a fancy to me for at the time in the year after he had been eight or nine years in england he begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way when he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me and he would make me his representative both with the in his privacy there was one singular exception however for he had a single room a lumberroom up among the attics which was invariably locked and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room one dayit was in march a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon for him to receive letters for his bills were all paid in ready money up pondicherry postmark what can this be opening it hurriedly out there jumped five little dried orange pips which pattered down upon lips at the sight of his face his lip had fallen his eyes were protruding his skin the colour of putty and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand k k k he shrieked and then my god my god my sins have overtaken me death said he and rising from the table he retired to his room scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap just above the gum the letter k three times repeated there was nothing else save the five dried an old rusty key which must have belonged to the attic in one hand and a small brass box like a cashbox in the other and send down to fordham the horsham lawyer up to the room the fire was burning brightly and in the grate there was a mass of black fluffy ashes as of burned paper while the brass read in the morning upon the envelope estate with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to my going to take kindly sign the paper where mr fordham shows you the singular incident made as you may think the deepest impression the vague feeling of dread which it left behind though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the he drank more than ever and he was less inclined for any sort of society most of his time he would spend in his room with the door locked upon the inside but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand screaming out that he was afraid of no man and that he was not to be cooped up like a sheep in a pen by man or devil when these hot fits were over however he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the day glisten with moisture as though it were new raised from a basin well to come to an end of the matter mr holmes and not to abuse your patience there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back we found him when we went to search for him face downward in a little greenscummed pool which lay at the foot of the garden there was no sign of any violence and the water was but two feet deep so that the jury having regard to his how he winced from the very thought of death had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it the matter passed however and my father entered into possession of the estate and of some which lay to his credit at the bank of the reception by your uncle of the letter and the date of his supposed suicide the letter arrived on march his death was seven weeks later upon the night of may nd thank you pray proceed when my father took over the horsham property he at my request made a careful examination of the attic which had been always locked up we found the brass box there although its contents had been destroyed on the inside of the cover was a paper label with the initials of k k k repeated upon it and letters memoranda receipts and a register written beneath these we presume indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by colonel openshaw for the rest there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and notebooks bearing upon my uncles life in america some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier others were of a date during the reconstruction of the southern states and were mostly concerned with politics for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpetbag politicians who had been sent down from the north well it was the beginning of when my father came to live at horsham and all went as well as possible with us until the january of sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfasttable there he was sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one he had always laughed at what he called my cockandbull story about the colonel but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon why what on earth does this mean john he stammered he looked inside the envelope so it is he cried here are the very letters but what is this written above them what papers what sundial he asked papers must be those that are destroyed pooh said he gripping hard at his courage we are in a civilised land here and we cant have tomfoolery of this kind where does the thing come from and be laughed at for my pains nothing of the sort then let me do so went about however with a heart which was full of forebodings on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his major freebody who is in command for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away once my father had fallen over one of the deep chalkpits which abound in the neighbourhood and was lying senseless with a shattered skull consciousness he had as it appears been returning from fareham in the twilight and as the country was unknown to him and the chalkpit unfenced the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of death idea of murder there were no signs of violence no footmarks no robbery no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads and was wellnigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncles life and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in had begun to take comfort too soon however yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father the young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips this is the envelope he continued the postmark is londoneastern division within are the very words which were upon my fathers last message k k k and then put the papers on the sundial what have you done asked holmes resistless inexorable evil which no foresight and no precautions can guard against tut tut cried sherlock holmes you must act man or you are lost nothing but energy can save you this is no time for despair inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents as the jury stated and were not to be connected with the warnings they have however allowed me a policeman who may remain in the house with me has he come with you tonight no his orders were to stay in the house again holmes raved in the air why did you come to me he said and above all why did you not come at once about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you you have placed before usno suggestive detail which might help us there is one thing said john openshaw he rummaged in his coat pocket and drawing out a piece of discoloured bluetinted paper he unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has perhaps fluttered out from among the others and in that way has escaped writing is undoubtedly my uncles holmes moved the lamp and we both bent over the sheet of paper which was headed march and beneath were the following enigmatical th hudson came same old platform th set the pips on mccauley paramore and john swain of st th mccauley cleared th john swain cleared thank you said holmes folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor and now you must on no account lose another instant we cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me you must get home instantly and act this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that this is the only one which remains you must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them having done this you must at once put the box out upon the sundial as directed do you understand that we may gain that by means of the law but we have our web to weave while theirs is already woven the first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties do not lose an instant and above all take care of yourself in the threatened by a very real and imminent danger how do you go back by train from waterloo may be in safety and yet you cannot guard yourself too closely he shook hands with us and took his leave outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows this strange wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elementsblown in upon us like a sheet of seaweed in a galeand now to have been reabsorbed by them once more sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire then he lit his pipe and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smokerings as they chased each other up to the ceiling had none more fantastic than this save perhaps the sign of four well yes save perhaps that and yet this john openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the sholtos these perils are there can be no question as to their nature he answered then what are they who is this k k k and why does he pursue this unhappy family sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair with his fingertips together the ideal reasoner he remarked would when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it as cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones both before and after we have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses to carry the art however to its highest pitch it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge and this in itself implies as you will readily see a possession of all knowledge which even in these days of free education and encyclopdias is a somewhat rare possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work you on one occasion in the early days of our friendship defined my limits in a very precise fashion variable geology profound as regards the mudstains from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime records unique violinplayer boxer think were the main points of my analysis then that a man should keep his little brainattic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the rest he can put away in the lumberroom of his library where he can get it if he wants it now for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us tonight we need certainly to muster all our resources kindly hand me down the letter k of the american encyclopdia which stands upon the shelf beside you thank you now let us consider the situation and see strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving america men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for the lonely life of an english provincial town his extreme love of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from america as to what it was he feared we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors did you remark the postmarks of those letters the first was from pondicherry the second from dundee and the third from london from east london what do you deduce from that they are all seaports that the writer was on board of a ship excellent we have already a clue there can be no doubt that the probabilitythe strong probabilityis that the writer was on board of a pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment in dundee it was only some three or four days does that suggest a greater distance to travel but the letter had also a greater distance to come there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from arrived almost as soon as their letter but as a matter of fact seven difference between the mailboat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance but this one comes from london and therefore we cannot count upon delay the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to clear that there must be more than one of them a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroners jury there must have been several in it and they must have been men of resource and determination their papers they mean to have be the the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society but of what society have you never said sherlock holmes bending forward and sinking his voicehave you never heard of the ku klux klan holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee here it is said he presently ku klux klan a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle this terrible secret society was formed by some exconfederate soldiers in the southern states after the civil war and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country notably in tennessee louisiana the carolinas georgia the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shapea sprig of oakleaves in some parts melon seeds or orange pips in others on receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways or might fly from the him and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner so perfect was the organisation of the society and so systematic its methods that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators for some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the united states government and of the better classes of the community in the south eventually in the year the movement rather suddenly collapsed although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date you will observe said holmes laying down the volume that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance more implacable spirits upon their track you can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the south and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is then the page we have seen pips to a b and cthat is sent the societys warning to them then there are successive entries that a and b cleared or left the country be done tonight so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city foresee a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young have to go down to horsham after all you will not go there first will bring up your coffee my eye caught the name of openshaw and the heading tragedy near waterloo bridge here is the account between nine and ten last night policeconstable cook of the h division on duty near waterloo bridge heard a cry for help and a splash in the water the night however was extremely dark and stormy so that in spite of the help of several passersby it was quite impossible to effect a rescue the alarm however was given and by proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket was john openshaw and whose hurrying down to catch the last train from waterloo station and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landingplaces for river steamboats the body exhibited no traces of violence and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landingstages we sat in silence for some minutes holmes more depressed and shaken his death he sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands they must be cunning devils he exclaimed at last how could they have decoyed him down there the embankment is not on the direct line to the station the bridge no doubt was too crowded even on such a night for their purpose well watson we shall see who will win in to the police the flies but not before worn he walked up to the sideboard and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously washing it down with a long draught of and how have you succeeded you have a clue remain unavenged why watson let us put their own devilish trademark what do you mean he took an orange from the cupboard and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope on the inside of the flap he wrote s h for j o then he sealed it and addressed it to captain james calhoun barque lone star savannah georgia give him a sleepless night he will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him and who is this captain calhoun how did you trace it then he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket all covered with dates and names files of the old papers following the future career of every vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and february in there were thirtysix ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months of these one the lone star instantly attracted my attention since although it was reported as having cleared from london the name is that which is given to one of the states of the american origin what then then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide learned that she had passed some time ago and as the wind is easterly what will you do then only nativeborn americans in the ship the others are finns and the time that their sailingship reaches savannah the mailboat will have carried this letter and the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder there is ever a flaw however in the best laid of human plans and the murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another as cunning and as resolute as themselves gales that year we waited long for news of the lone star of savannah but none ever reached us we did at last hear that somewhere far out in the atlantic a shattered sternpost of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave with the letters l s carved upon it and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the lone theological college of st georges was much addicted to opium the was at college for having read de quinceys description of his dreams and sensations he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects he found as so many more have done that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug an object of mingled horror and pasty face drooping lids and pinpoint pupils all huddled in a chair the wreck and ruin of a noble man one nightit was in june there came a ring to my bell about the in my chair and my wife laid her needlework down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment a patient said she youll have to go out we heard the door open a few hurried words and then quick steps upon the linoleum our own door flew open and a lady clad in some darkcoloured stuff with a black veil entered the room you will excuse my calling so late she began and then suddenly losing her selfcontrol she ran forward threw her arms about my why said my wife pulling up her veil it is kate whitney how you the way folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a water and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it or should you trouble to me as a doctor to my wife as an old friend and school companion we soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find did she know where her husband was was it possible that we could bring him back to her had when the fit was on him made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the city hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day and he had come back twitching and shattered in the evening but now the spell had been upon him eightandforty hours and he lay there doubtless among the dregs of the docks breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects there he was to be found she was sure of it at the bar of gold in upper swandam lane but what was she to do how could she a young and timid woman make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him there was the case and of course there was but one way out of it within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given sittingroom behind me and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand as it seemed to me at the time though the future only could show how strange it was to be but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure upper swandam lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of london bridge between a slopshop and a ginshop approached by a steep flight of the steps worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken the latch and made my way into a long low room thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke and terraced with wooden berths like the forecastle of an emigrant ship through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses bowed shoulders bent knees heads thrown back and chins pointing upward with here and there a dark lacklustre eye turned upon the newcomer out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light now bright now faint as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes the most lay silent but some muttered to themselves and others talked together in a strange low monotonous voice their conversation coming in gushes and then suddenly tailing off into silence each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour at the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal beside which on a threelegged wooden stool there sat a tall thin old man with his jaw resting upon his two fists and his elbows upon his knees staring into the fire me and a supply of the drug beckoning me to an empty berth there was a movement and an exclamation from my right and peering out at me nearly eleven of what day of friday june th want to frighten a chap for he sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key days for you you should be ashamed of yourself you a cab holding my breath to keep out the vile stupefying fumes of the drug whispered walk past me and then look back at me the words fell from the old man at my side and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever very thin very wrinkled bent with age an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude my selfcontrol to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of his form had filled out his wrinkles were gone the dull eyes had regained their fire and there sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise was none other than sherlock holmes he made a slight motion to me to approach him and instantly as he turned his face half round to the company once more subsided into a doddering looselipped should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you then pray send him home in it you may safely trust him for he also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have you in five minutes were always so exceedingly definite and put forward with such a quiet could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his was walking down the street with sherlock holmes for two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot then glancing quickly round he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter opiumsmoking to cocaine injections and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views an enemy have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots as for my own purposes and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me there is a trapdoor at the back of that building near the corner of pauls wharf which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights what you do not mean bodies ay bodies watson we should be rich men if we had for every has entered it never to leave it more but our trap should be here he put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrillya signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses hoofs now watson said holmes as a tall dogcart dashed up through the gloom throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns youll come with me wont you oh a trusty comrade is always of use and a chronicler still more so my room at the cedars is a doublebedded one the cedars the inquiry where is it then near lee in kent we have a sevenmile drive before us of course you are youll know all about it presently jump up here all right john we shall not need you heres half a crown look out for me tomorrow about eleven give her her head so long then he flicked the horse with his whip and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets which widened gradually until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar its silence broken only by the heavy regular footfall of the policeman or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers a dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds holmes drove in silence with his head sunk upon his him curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts we had driven several miles and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas when he shook himself shrugged his shoulders and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best quite invaluable as a companion pon my word it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to for my own thoughts are not woman tonight when she meets me at the door watson and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me proceed then some years agoto be definite in may there came to lee a gentleman neville st clair by name who appeared to have plenty of money he took a large villa laid out the grounds very nicely and lived generally in good style by degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood and in he married the daughter of a local brewer by whom he now has two children he had no occupation but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning returning by the from cannon street every night mr st clair is now thirtyseven years of age is a man of temperate habits a good husband a very affectionate father and a man who is popular with as far as we have been able to ascertain amount to s while he has standing to his credit in the capital and counties bank there is no reason therefore to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind last monday mr neville st clair went into town rather earlier than usual remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks now by the merest chance his wife received a telegram upon this same monday very shortly after his departure to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the aberdeen shipping company now if you are well up in your london you will know that the office of the company is in fresno street which branches out of upper swandam lane where you found me tonight mrs st clair had her lunch started for the city did some shopping proceeded to the companys office got her packet and found herself at exactly walking through swandam lane on her way back to the station have you followed me so far walked slowly glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself while she was walking in this way down swandam lane she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and as it seemed to her beckoning to her from a secondfloor window the window was open and she distinctly saw his face which she describes as being terribly agitated he waved his hands frantically to her and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat such as he had started to town in he had on neither collar nor necktie convinced that something was amiss with him she rushed down the stepsfor the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me tonightand running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor at the foot of the who thrust her back and aided by a dane who acts as assistant there pushed her out into the street filled with the most maddening doubts and fears she rushed down the lane and by rare goodfortune met in fresno street a number of constables with an inspector all on their way to their beat the inspector and two men accompanied her back and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor they made their way to the room in which mr st clair had last been seen there was no to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect who it seems made his home there both he and the lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon so determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered and had almost come to believe that mrs st clair had been deluded when with a cry she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid which he had promised to bring home this discovery and the evident confusion which the cripple showed made the inspector realise that the matter was serious the rooms were carefully examined and results all pointed to an abominable crime the front room was plainly furnished as a sittingroom and led into a small bedroom which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water the bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below on examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of mr neville st clair with the exception of his coat his boots his socks his hat and his watchall were there there were no signs of violence upon any of these garments and there were no other traces of mr neville st clair out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy and now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter the lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents but as by mrs st clairs story he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husbands appearance at the window he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime his defence was one of absolute ignorance and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone his lodger and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentlemans clothes so much for the lascar manager now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st clair his name is hugh boone and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the city he is a professional beggar though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas some little distance down threadneedle street upon the lefthand side there is as you may have remarked a small angle in the wall here it is that this creature takes his daily seat crosslegged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy reaped in a short time his appearance you see is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him a shock of orange hair a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar which by its contraction has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip a bulldog chin and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so too does his wit for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passersby this is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest a man in the prime of life he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and wellnurtured man surely your medical experience would tell you watson that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others pray continue your narrative mrs st clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window and she was escorted home in a cab by the police as her presence could had charge of the case made a very careful examination of the premises but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter one mistake had been made in not arresting boone instantly as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the lascar but this fault was soon remedied and he was seized and searched without anything being found which could incriminate him there were it is true some bloodstains upon his right shirtsleeve but he pointed to his ringfinger which had been cut near the nail and explained that the bleeding came from there adding that he had been to the window not long before and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source he denied strenuously having ever seen mr neville st clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police as to mrs st clairs assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming he was removed loudly protesting to the policestation while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh and it did though they hardly found upon the mudbank what they had clair which lay uncovered as the tide receded and what do you think they found in the pockets that it had not been swept away by the tide but a human body is a different matter there is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the the stripped body had been sucked away into the river would the body be dressed in a coat alone no sir but the facts might be met speciously enough suppose that this man boone had thrust neville st clair through the window there is no human eye which could have seen the deed what would he do then telltale garments he would seize the coat then and be in the act of throwing it out when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink he has little time for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up and perhaps he has already heard from his lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street there is not an instant to be lost he rushes to some secret hoard where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coats sinking he throws it out and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared well we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him he had for years been known as a professional beggar but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one there the matter stands at present and the questions which have to be solvedwhat neville st clair was doing in the opium den what happened to him when there where is he now and what hugh boone had to do with his cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties while sherlock holmes had been detailing this singular series of events we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us just as he finished however we drove through two scattered villages where a few lights still glimmered in the windows we are on the outskirts of lee said my companion we have touched on three english counties in our short drive starting in middlesex passing over an angle of surrey and ending in kent see that light among the trees that is the cedars and beside that lamp sits a woman of our horses feet because there are many inquiries which must be made out here mrs st clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and husband here we are whoa there whoa we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds a stableboy had run out to the horses head and springing the house as we approached the door flew open and a little blonde woman stood in the opening clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists she stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light one hand upon the door one halfraised in her eagerness her body slightly bent her head and face protruded with eager eyes and parted lips a standing question well she cried well and then seeing that there were two of us she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders no good news no bad thank god for that but come in you must be weary for you have had a long day this is my friend dr watson he has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation arrangements when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us now mr sherlock holmes said the lady as we entered a welllit diningroom upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out certainly madam upon what point sherlock holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question frankly now she repeated standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basketchair you think that he is dead and on what day did he meet his death on monday then perhaps mr holmes you will be good enough to explain how it is sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised what he roared yes today she stood smiling holding up a little slip of paper in the air he snatched it from her in his eagerness and smoothing it out upon the chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder the envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day or rather of the day before for it was considerably after midnight coarse writing murmured holmes surely this is not your husbands writing madam no but the enclosure is inquire as to the address how can you tell that the name you see is in perfectly black ink which has dried itself the rest is of the greyish colour which shows that blottingpaper has would be of a deep black shade this man has written the name and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address which can only there is nothing so important as trifles let us now see the letter ha there has been an enclosure here yes there was a ring his signetring and you are sure that this is your husbands hand one of his hands dearest do not be frightened all will come well there is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify wait in octavo size no watermark hum posted today in gravesend by a man much in error by a person who had been chewing tobacco and you have no doubt that it is your husbands hand madam none neville wrote those words and they were posted today at gravesend well mrs st clair the but he must be alive mr holmes unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent the no no it is it is his very own writing posted today that is possible with the utmost certainty that something had happened do you think more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner and in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view but if your husband is alive and able to write letters why should he remain away from you and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane was the window open then he might have called to you he might a call for help you thought yes he waved his hands but it might have been a cry of surprise astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands and you thought he was pulled back he disappeared so suddenly he might have leaped back you did not see anyone else in the room no but this horrible man confessed to having been there and the lascar was at the foot of the stairs quite so your husband as far as you could see had his ordinary clothes on had he ever spoken of swandam lane had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium thank you mrs st clair those are the principal points about which then retire for we may have a very busy day tomorrow a large and comfortable doublebedded room had been placed at our my night of adventure sherlock holmes was a man however who when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind would go for days and even for a week without rest turning it over rearranging his facts looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or to me that he was now preparing for an allnight sitting he took off his coat and waistcoat put on a large blue dressinggown and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs with these he constructed a sort of eastern divan upon which he perched himself crosslegged with an between his lips his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling the blue smoke curling up from him silent motionless with dropped off to sleep and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me pipe was still between his lips the smoke still curled upward and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze but nothing remained of the heap awake watson he asked game for a morning drive sleeps and we shall soon have the trap out he chuckled to himself as he spoke his eyes twinkled and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the my boy and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible and out into the halfclad stableboy waiting at the head we both sprang in and away we dashed down the london road a few country carts were stirring bearing in vegetables to the metropolis but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey side passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the river and dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in bow street sherlock holmes was well known to the force and the two constables at the door saluted him one of them held the horses head while the other led us in who is on duty asked holmes ah bradstreet how are you a tall stout official had come down the have a quiet word with you bradstreet certainly mr holmes step into my room here and a telephone projecting from the wall the inspector sat down at his being concerned in the disappearance of mr neville st clair of lee yes he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries oh he gives no trouble but he is a dirty scoundrel yes it is all we can do to make him wash his hands and his face is as black as a tinkers well when once his case has been settled he agree with me that he needed it would you that is easily done come this way you can leave your opened a barred door passed down a winding stair and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side the third on the right is his said the inspector here it is he quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced he is asleep said he you can see him very well we both put our eyes to the grating the prisoner lay with his face towards us in a very deep sleep breathing slowly and heavily he was a middlesized man coarsely clad as became his calling with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat he was as the inspector had said extremely dirty but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness a broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl a shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead hes a beauty isnt he said the inspector the gladstone bag as he spoke and took out to my astonishment a very large bathsponge he he you are a funny one chuckled the inspector now if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure credit to the bow street cells does he he slipped his key into the lock and we all very quietly entered the cell the sleeper half turned and then settled down once more into a deep slumber holmes stooped to the waterjug moistened his sponge and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoners face let me introduce you he shouted to mr neville st clair of lee in the county of kent under the sponge like the bark from a tree gone was the coarse brown tint gone too was the horrid scar which had seamed it across and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face a twitch brought away the tangled red hair and there sitting up in his bed was a pale sadfaced refinedlooking man blackhaired and smoothskinned rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment then suddenly realising the exposure he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow great heavens cried the inspector it is indeed the missing man the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself with making away with mr neville st oh come you cant be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it said the force but this really takes the cake no crime but a very great error has been committed said holmes you would have done better to have trusted your wife sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder of course you can hardly avoid publicity on the other hand if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities the case would then never go into court at all imprisonment ay even execution rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children you are the first who have ever heard my story my father was a reporter on an evening paper in london one day my editor wished to volunteered to supply them there was the point from which all my had of course learned all the secrets of making up and had been the aid of a small slip of fleshcoloured plaster then with a red head part of the city ostensibly as a matchseller but really as a beggar for a holiday from my employers and spent the time in begging in the well you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work smearing my face with a little paint laying my cap on the ground and face and filling my pockets with coppers only one man knew my secret evenings transform myself into a welldressed man about town this that my secret was safe in his possession advantages in my power of making up and also in a facility of repartee which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the city all day a stream of pennies varied by silver and eventually married without anyone having a suspicion as to my real little knew what horror and astonishment that my wife was standing in the street with to cover my face and rushing to my confidant the lascar entreated my clothes pulled on those of a beggar and put on my pigments and wig even a wifes eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise but then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room and disappeared into the thames the other clothes would have followed but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair and a few determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible and hence my preference for a dirty face knowing that my wife would be terribly moment when no constable was watching me together with a hurried scrawl telling her that she had no cause to fear that note only reached her yesterday said holmes good god what a week she must have spent unobserved probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his who forgot all about it for some days it but have you never been prosecuted for begging many times but what was a fine to me hush this thing up there must be no more of hugh boone mr holmes that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared street we shall just be in time for breakfast after christmas with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season he was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressinggown a piperack within his reach upon the right and a pile of crumpled morning papers evidently newly studied near at hand beside the couch was a wooden chair and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hardfelt hat much the worse for wear and cracked in several places a lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination results the matter is a perfectly trivial onehe jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hatbut there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction crackling fire for a sharp frost had set in and the windows were it looks this thing has some deadly story linked on to itthat it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime no no no crime said sherlock holmes laughing only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity every possible combination of events may be expected to take place and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal we have already had experience of added to my notes three have been entirely free of any legal crime to the singular case of miss mary sutherland and to the adventure of matter will fall into the same innocent category you know peterson the commissionaire upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem at this moment in front of petersons fire the facts are these about four oclock on christmas morning peterson who as you know is a very honest fellow was returning from some small jollification and was saw in the gaslight a tallish man walking with a slight stagger and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder as he reached the corner of goodge street a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs one of the latter knocked off the mans hat on which he raised his stick to defend himself and swinging it over his head smashed the shop window behind him peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants but the man shocked at having broken the window and seeing an officiallooking person in uniform rushing towards him dropped his goose took to his heels and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham court road the roughs had also fled at the appearance of peterson so that he was left in possession of the field of battle and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable christmas goose which surely he restored to their owner henry baker was printed upon a small card which was tied to the birds left leg and it is also true that the initials h b are legible upon the lining of this hat but as there are some thousands of bakers and some hundreds of henry bakers in this city of ours it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them what then did peterson do he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me the goose we retained until this morning when there were signs that in spite of the slight frost it would be well that it should be eaten hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his christmas dinner did he not advertise then what clue could you have as to his identity only as much as we can deduce from his hat but you are joking what can you gather from this old battered felt here is my lens you know my methods what can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article hard and much the worse for wear the lining had been of red silk but was a good deal discoloured there was no makers name but as holmes pierced in the brim for a hatsecurer but the elastic was missing for the rest it was cracked exceedingly dusty and spotted in several places although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink on the contrary watson you can see everything you fail however to reason from what you see you are too timid in drawing your then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat he picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion might have been he remarked and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability that the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it and also that he was fairly welltodo within the last three years although he has now fallen upon evil days he had foresight but has less now than formerly pointing to a moral retrogression which when taken with the decline of his fortunes seems to indicate some evil influence probably drink at work upon him this may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him my dear holmes he has however retained some degree of selfrespect he continued disregarding my remonstrance he is a man who leads a sedentary life goes out little is out of training entirely is middleaged has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days and which he anoints with limecream these are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat also by the way that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house you are certainly joking holmes results you are unable to see how they are attained unable to follow you for example how did you deduce that this man was cubic capacity said he a man with so large a brain must have something in it the decline of his fortunes then this hat is three years old these flat brims curled at the edge came so expensive a hat three years ago and has had no hat since then he has assuredly gone down in the world well that is clear enough certainly but how about the foresight and the moral retrogression sherlock holmes laughed here is the foresight said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hatsecurer they are certain amount of foresight since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind but since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature on the other hand he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his selfrespect your reasoning is certainly plausible the further points that he is middleaged that his hair is grizzled that it has been recently cut and that he uses limecream are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining the lens discloses a large number of hairends clean cut by the scissors of the barber they all appear to be adhesive and there is a distinct odour of limecream this dust you will observe is not the gritty grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely and could therefore hardly be in the best of but his wifeyou said that she had ceased to love him watson with a weeks accumulation of dust upon your hat and when your have been unfortunate enough to lose your wifes affection but he might be a bachelor nay he was bringing home the goose as a peaceoffering to his wife remember the card upon the birds leg you have an answer to everything but how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallowwalks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other anyhow he never got tallowstains from a gasjet are you satisfied just now there has been no crime committed and no harm done save the loss of a goose all this seems to be rather a waste of energy sherlock holmes had opened his mouth to reply when the door flew open and peterson the commissionaire rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment the goose mr holmes the goose sir he gasped eh what of it then has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the mans excited face see here sir see what my wife found in its crop he held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone rather smaller than a bean in size but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand sherlock holmes sat up with a whistle by jove peterson said he absolutely unique and its value can only be conjectured but the reward offered of is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price a thousand pounds great lord of mercy the commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the precisely so on december nd just five days ago john horner a plumber was accused of having abstracted it from the ladys jewelcase the evidence against him was so strong that the case has believe he rummaged amid his newspapers glancing over the dates until at last he smoothed one out doubled it over and read the following paragraph hotel cosmopolitan jewel robbery john horner plumber was brought up upon the charge of having upon the nd inst abstracted from the jewelcase of the countess of morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle james ryder upperattendant at the hotel gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown horner up to the dressingroom of the countess of morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate which was loose he had remained with horner some little time but had finally been called away on returning he found that horner had disappeared that the bureau had been forced open and that the small morocco casket in which as it afterwards transpired the countess was accustomed to keep her jewel was lying empty upon the dressingtable ryder instantly gave the alarm and horner was arrested the same evening but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms catherine cusack maid to the countess deposed to having heard ryders cry of dismay on discovering the robbery and to having rushed into the room bradstreet b division gave evidence as to the arrest of horner who struggled frantically and protested his innocence in the strongest terms evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence but referred it to the assizes horner who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court hum so much for the policecourt said holmes thoughtfully tossing aside the paper the question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewelcase at one end to the crop of a goose in tottenham court road at the other you see watson our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect here is the stone the stone came from the goose and the goose came from mr henry baker the gentleman with the bad hat and must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery to do this we must try the simplest means first and these lie undoubtedly have recourse to other methods what will you say give me a pencil and that slip of paper now then found at the corner of goodge street a goose and a black felt hat mr henry baker can have the same by applying at this evening at b baker street that is clear and concise well he is sure to keep an eye on the papers since to a poor man the loss was a heavy one he was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson that he thought of nothing but flight but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird then again the introduction of his name will cause him to see it for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it here you are peterson run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening oh in the globe star pall mall st jamess gazette evening news standard echo and any others that occur to you buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring when the commissionaire had gone holmes took up the stone and held it glints and sparkles of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed this stone is not southern china and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the of its youth it has already a sinister history there have been two murders a vitriolthrowing a suicide and several robberies brought about for the sake of this fortygrain weight of crystallised charcoal who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows the countess to say that we have it do you think that this man horner is innocent well then do you imagine that this other one henry baker had anything to do with the matter innocent man who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold that to our advertisement and you can do nothing until then to see the solution of so tangled a business hudson to examine its crop buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which and we were shown up together to holmes room greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so summer than for winter ah watson you have just come at the right yes sir that is undoubtedly my hat he was a large man with rounded shoulders a massive head and a broad intelligent face sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown a touch of red in nose and cheeks with a slight tremor of his extended hand recalled holmes surmise as to his habits his rusty black frockcoat was buttoned right up in front with the collar turned up and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt he spoke in a slow staccato fashion choosing his words with care and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had illusage at the hands of fortune we have retained these things for some days said holmes because we a loss to know now why you did not advertise our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh shillings have not been so the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the recovering them to eat it our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement presume that this other goose upon the sideboard which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh will answer your purpose equally oh certainly certainly answered mr baker with a sigh of relief of course we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of your own bird so if you wish the man burst into a hearty laugh they might be useful to me as what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his there is your hat then and there your bird said he by the way certainly sir said baker who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm there are a few of us who frequent the alpha day you understand this year our good host windigate by name instituted a goose club by which on consideration of some few pence every week we were each to receive a bird at christmas my pence were sir for a scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity with a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way so much for mr henry baker said holmes when he had closed the door the matter are you hungry watson not particularly this clue while it is still hot by all means about our throats outside the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky and the breath of the passersby blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors quarter wimpole street harley street publichouse at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into holborn holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddyfaced whiteaproned landlord your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese said my geese the man seemed surprised a member of your goose club breckinridge is his name prosperity to your house goodnight now for mr breckinridge he continued buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air remember watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years penal servitude unless confirm his guilt but in any case we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police and which a singular chance has placed in our hands let us follow it out to the bitter end faces to the south then and quick march we passed across holborn down endell street and so through a zigzag of slums to covent garden market one of the largest stalls bore the name of breckinridge upon it and the proprietor a horseylooking man with a sharp face and trim sidewhiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters the salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion slabs of marble let you have five hundred tomorrow morning thats no good well there are some on the stall with the gasflare who by the landlord of the alpha fine birds they were too now where did you get them from to my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the now then mister said he with his head cocked and his arms akimbo what are you driving at lets have it straight now which you supplied to the alpha be so warm over such a trifle pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business but its where are the geese and who did you sell the geese to and what will you take for the geese one would think they were the only geese in the world to hear the fuss that is made over well then youve lost your fiver for its town bred snapped the alpha were town bred youll never persuade me to believe that will you bet then have a sovereign on with you just to teach you not to be obstinate the salesman chuckled grimly bring me the books bill said he the small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasybacked one laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp in my shop you see this little book here on this page are the country folk and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger now then you see this other page in red ink well that is a list of my town suppliers now look at that third name just read it out to me mrs oakshott brixton road read holmes quite so now turn that up in the ledger holmes turned to the page indicated here you are mrs oakshott brixton road egg and poultry supplier now then whats the last entry december nd twentyfour geese at s d quite so there you are and underneath sold to mr windigate of the alpha at s what have you to say now sherlock holmes looked deeply chagrined he drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words a few yards off he stopped under a lamppost and laughed in the hearty noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him when you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the pink un protruding out of his pocket you can always draw him by a bet said would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him fancy nearing the end of our quest and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this mrs oakshott from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides his remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left turning round we saw a little ratfaced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp while breckinridge the salesman framed in the door of his stall was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure off you no but one of them was mine all the same whined the little man well then ask mrs oakshott for it she told me to ask you of it get out of this he rushed fiercely forward and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness ha this may save us a visit to brixton road whispered holmes come with me and we will see what is to be made of this fellow striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face who are you then what do you want he asked in a quavering voice you who are you how could you know anything of the matter people dont know but you can know nothing of this geese which were sold by mrs oakshott of brixton road to a salesman named breckinridge by him in turn to mr windigate of the alpha and by him to his club of which mr henry baker is a member we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this windswept marketplace said he but pray tell me before we go farther who it the man hesitated for an instant my name is john robinson he answered with a sidelong glance doing business with an alias a flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger well then said he my real name is james ryder precisely so head attendant at the hotel cosmopolitan pray step into would wish to know the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with halffrightened halfhopeful eyes as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe then he stepped into the cab and in half an hour we were back in the sittingroom at baker street nothing had been said during our drive but the high thin breathing of our new companion and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands spoke of the nervous tension within him here we are said holmes cheerily as we filed into the room the fire looks very seasonable in this weather you look cold mr ryder settle this little matter of yours now then you want to know what became of those geese yes sir you were interestedwhite with a black bar across the tail ryder quivered with emotion oh sir he cried can you tell me where it went to in my museum our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand holmes unlocked his strongbox and held up the blue carbuncle which shone out like a star with a cold brilliant manypointed radiance ryder stood glaring with a drawn face uncertain whether to claim or to disown it the games up ryder said holmes quietly hold up man or youll be into the fire give him an arm back into his chair watson hes not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity give him a dash of brandy so now he looks a little more human what a shrimp it is to be sure for a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser possibly need so there is little which you need tell me still that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete you had heard ryder of this blue stone of the countess of morcars wealth so easily acquired was too much for you as it has been for better men before you but you were not very scrupulous in the means pretty villain in you you knew that this man horner the plumber had been concerned in some such matter before and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him what did you do then you made some small job in my ladys roomyou and your confederate cusackand you managed that he should be the man sent for then when he had left you rifled the jewelcase raised the alarm and had this unfortunate man arrested you then ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companions knees for gods sake have mercy he shrieked think of oh dont bring it into court for christs sake dont cringe and crawl now but you thought little enough of this poor horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing against him will break down hum we will talk about that and now let us hear a true account of the next act how came the stone into the goose and how came the goose into the open market tell us the truth for there lies your only hope of safety as it happened sir said he when horner had been arrested it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at into their heads to search me and my room there was no place about the lived in brixton road where she fattened fowls for the market all the detective and for all that it was a cold night the sweat was pouring and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do been serving his time in pentonville one day he had met me and fell into talk about the ways of thieves and how they could get rid of what he lived and take him into my confidence he would show me how to turn moment be seized and searched and there would be the stone in my looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet and best detective that ever lived stone to kilburn there was a little shed in the yard and behind this stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop but the creature flapped and struggled and out came my sister to know what was the off among the others whatever were you doing with that bird jem says she feeling which was the fattest oh says she weve set yours aside for youjems bird we call it makes one for you and one for us and two dozen for the market the other is a good three pound heavier said she and we fattened it expressly for you oh just as you like said she a little huffed which is it you want then that white one with the barred tail right in the middle of the oh very well kill it and take it with you was easy to tell a thing like that to he laughed until he choked and we got a knife and opened the goose my heart turned to water for into the back yard there was not a bird to be seen there gone to the dealers jem which dealers breckinridge of covent garden them apart would carry me to this man breckinridge but he had sold the lot at once and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone you heard him yourselves tonight well he has always answered me like god help me he burst into convulsive sobbing with his face buried in his hands there was a long silence broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of sherlock holmes fingertips upon the edge of the table then my friend rose and threw open the door get out said he what sir oh heaven bless you no more words get out and no more words were needed there was a rush a clatter upon the stairs the bang of a door and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street after all watson said holmes reaching up his hand for his clay horner were in danger it would be another thing but this fellow will this fellow will not go wrong again he is too terribly frightened send him to gaol now and you make him a gaolbird for life besides it is the season of forgiveness chance has put in our way a most you will have the goodness to touch the bell doctor we will begin another investigation in which also a bird will be the chief during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend sherlock but none commonplace for working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual and even which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the wellknown surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran the events in question occurred in the early days of my association with freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom rumours as to the death of dr grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth sherlock holmes standing fully dressed by the side of my bed he was a late riser as a rule and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me regular in my habits this morning mrs hudson has been knocked up she retorted upon me what is it thena fire state of excitement who insists upon seeing me she is waiting now in the sittingroom now when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock sleepy people up out of their beds should call you and give you the chance investigations and in admiring the rapid deductions as swift as intuitions and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sittingroom a lady dressed in black and heavily veiled who had been sitting in the window rose as we entered goodmorning madam said holmes cheerily my name is sherlock holmes this is my intimate friend and associate dr watson before that mrs hudson has had the good sense to light the fire pray draw up you are shivering changing her seat as requested what then spoke and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation her face all drawn and grey with restless frightened eyes like those of some hunted animal her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty but her hair was shot with premature grey and her expression was weary and haggard sherlock holmes ran her over with one of his quick allcomprehensive glances you must not fear said he soothingly bending forward and patting you know me then your left glove you must have started early and yet you had a good drive in a dogcart along heavy roads before you reached the the lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my there is no mystery my dear madam said he smiling the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places the marks are perfectly fresh there is no vehicle save a dogcart which throws up mud in that way and then only when you sit on the lefthand side of the driver started from home before six reached leatherhead at twenty past and save only one who cares for me and he poor fellow can be of little help me too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me at present it is out of my power to reward with the control of my own income and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful holmes turned to his desk and unlocking it drew out a small casebook which he consulted did to that of your friend as to reward my profession is its own before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the alas replied our visitor the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to another that see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart you may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of surrey holmes nodded his head the name is familiar to me said he the family was at one time among the richest in england and the estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north and heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency nothing was left save a few acres of ground and the twohundredyearold house which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage the last squire dragged out his existence there living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper but his only son my stepfather seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions obtained an advance from a relative which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to calcutta where by his professional fit of anger however caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence as it was he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a morose and disappointed man young widow of majorgeneral stoner of the bengal artillery my sister my mothers remarriage she had a considerable sum of moneynot less than a yearand this she bequeathed to dr roylott entirely while we resided with him with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage shortly after our return to england my mother diedshe was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe dr roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran the money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time who had at first been overjoyed to see a roylott of stoke moran back in the old family seat he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his been intensified by his long residence in the tropics a series of disgraceful brawls took place two of which ended in the policecourt until at last he became the terror of the village and the folks would fly at his approach for he is a man of immense strength and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream friends at all save the wandering gipsies and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramblecovered land which represent the family estate and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents wandering away with them sometimes for over to him by a correspondent and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master great pleasure in our lives no servant would stay with us and for a long time we did all the work of the house she was but thirty at the time of her death and yet her hair had already begun to whiten even as mine has your sister is dead then described we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position we had however an aunt my mothers maiden sister miss honoria westphail who lives near harrow and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this ladys house julia went there at christmas two years ago and met there a halfpay major of marines to whom she became engaged my stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor pray be precise as to details said he old and only one wing is now inhabited the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sittingrooms being in the central block of the buildings of these bedrooms the first is dr roylotts the second my sisters and the third my own there is no communication between perfectly so the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn that fatal night dr roylott had gone to his room early though we knew that he had not retired to rest for my sister was troubled by the smell of the room therefore and came into mine where she sat for some time chatting about her approaching wedding at eleven oclock she rose to leave me but she paused at the door and looked back tell me helen said she have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night certainly not but why whether you had heard it not hear it also well it is of no great consequence at any rate she smiled back at at night and why baboon we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked quite so pray proceed with your statement know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely was beating and splashing against the windows suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified few moments later a clanging sound as if a mass of metal had fallen saw my sister appear at the opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground she writhed as one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were dreadfully was something else which she would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctors room but a dressinggown when he reached my sisters side she was unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister one moment said holmes are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound could you swear to it was your sister dressed charred stump of a match and in her left a matchbox showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place that is important and what conclusions did the coroner come to he investigated the case with great care for dr roylotts conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows were blocked by oldfashioned shutters with broad iron bars which were secured every night the walls were carefully sounded and were shown to be quite solid all round and the flooring was also thoroughly examined with the same result the chimney is wide but is barred up by four large she met her end besides there were no marks of any violence upon how about poison the doctors examined her for it but without success what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then were there gipsies in the plantation at the time yes there are nearly always some there ah and what did you gather from this allusion to a banda speckled sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people perhaps to handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied these are very deep waters said he pray go on with your two years have passed since then and my life has been until lately known for many years has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage his name is armitagepercy armitagethe second son of mr armitage of crane water near reading my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to be married in the course of the spring two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the move into the chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the you and asking your advice you have done wisely said my friend but have you told me all yes all miss roylott you have not you are screening your stepfather why what do you mean for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitors knee five little livid spots the marks of four fingers and a thumb were printed upon the white wrist you have been cruelly used said holmes the lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist he is a hard man she said and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength there was a long silence during which holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire this is a very deep business he said at last there are a thousand stoke moran today would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather as it happens he spoke of coming into town today upon some most that there would be nothing to disturb you we have a housekeeper now excellent you are not averse to this trip watson by no means then we shall both come what are you going to do yourself in time for your coming business matters to attend to will you not wait and breakfast afternoon she dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room and what do you think of it all watson asked sherlock holmes leaning back in his chair dark enough and sinister enough yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious what becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman when you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughters marriage the dying allusion to a band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of those metal bars there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines but what then did the gipsies do or if they may be explained away but what in the name of the devil the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture his costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural having a black tophat a long frockcoat and a pair of high gaiters with a huntingcrop swinging in his hand so tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side a large face seared with a thousand wrinkles burned yellow with the sun and marked with every evil passion was turned from one to the other of us while his deepset bileshot eyes and his high thin fleshless nose gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey which of you is holmes asked this apparition my name sir but you have the advantage of me said my companion traced her what has she been saying to you what has she been saying to you screamed the old man furiously companion imperturbably ha you put me off do you said our new visitor taking a step have heard of you before you are holmes the meddler my friend smiled holmes the busybody his smile broadened holmes the scotland yard jackinoffice holmes chuckled heartily your conversation is most entertaining said he when you go out close the door for there is a decided dangerous man to fall foul of see here he stepped swiftly forward seized the poker and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands see that you keep yourself out of my grip he snarled and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room grip was not much more feeble than his own as he spoke he picked up the steel poker and with a sudden effort straightened it out again fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force this incident gives zest to our investigation her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her and now watson we excursion he held in his hand a sheet of blue paper scrawled over with notes and figures investments with which it is concerned the total income which at the time of the wifes death was little short of is now through the fall in agricultural prices not more than each daughter can therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent my mornings work has not been wasted since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort and now watson this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs so if you are ready we shall call a cab and revolver into your pocket an eleys no is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots that and a at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth to me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged my companion sat in the front of the trap his arms folded his hat pulled down over his eyes and his chin sunk upon his breast buried in the deepest thought suddenly however he started tapped me on the shoulder and pointed over the meadows look there said he a heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope thickening into a grove at the highest point from amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high rooftree of a very old mansion stoke moran said he yes sir that be the house of dr grimesby roylott remarked the there is some building going on there said holmes that is where we are going theres the village said the driver pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left but if you want to get to the house youll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by the footpath over the fields there it is where the lady is walking we got off paid our fare and the trap rattled back on its way to fellow should think we had come here as architects or on some definite that we have been as good as our word our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face cried shaking hands with us warmly all has turned out splendidly dr roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening we have had the pleasure of making the doctors acquaintance said holmes and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred miss stoner turned white to the lips as she listened good heavens she cried he has followed me then so it appears he say when he returns he must guard himself for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track you must lock yourself up from him harrow now we must make the best use of our time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine the building was of grey lichenblotched stone with a high central portion and two curving wings like the claws of a crab thrown out on with wooden boards while the roof was partly caved in a picture of ruin the central portion was in little better repair but the righthand block was comparatively modern and the blinds in the windows with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys showed that this was where the family resided some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall and the stonework had been broken into but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit holmes walked slowly up and down the illtrimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows centre one to your sisters and the one next to the main building to dr roylotts chamber seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall ah that is suggestive now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open there are windows in it of course yes but very small ones too narrow for anyone to pass through as you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that side now would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters miss stoner did so and holmes after a careful examination through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open but without success there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar then with his lens he tested the hinges but they were of solid iron built firmly into the massive masonry hum said he scratching his chin in some perplexity my theory certainly presents some difficulties no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened holmes refused to examine the third chamber so we passed at once to the second that in which miss stoner was now homely little room with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace after the fashion of old countryhouses a brown chest of drawers stood in one corner a narrow whitecounterpaned bed in another and a dressingtable on the lefthand side of the window these articles with two small wickerwork chairs made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre the boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown wormeaten oak so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down taking in every detail of the apartment where does that bell communicate with he asked at last pointing to a thick bellrope which hung down beside the bed the tassel actually lying upon the pillow yes it was only put there a couple of years ago wanted for ourselves floor he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward examining minutely the cracks between the boards then he did the same with the woodwork with which the chamber was panelled finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall finally he took the bellrope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug why its a dummy said he wont it ring no it is not even attached to a wire this is very interesting you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is two very singular points about this room for example what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room when with the same trouble he might have communicated with the outside air that is also quite modern said the lady done about the same time as the bellrope remarked holmes yes there were several little changes carried out about that time they seem to have been of a most interesting characterdummy bellropes and ventilators which do not ventilate with your permission miss stoner we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment dr grimesby roylotts chamber was larger than that of his stepdaughter but was as plainly furnished a campbed a small wooden shelf full of books mostly of a technical character an armchair beside the bed a plain wooden chair against the wall a round table and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest whats in here he asked tapping the safe my stepfathers business papers oh you have seen inside then there isnt a cat in it for example no what a strange idea well look at this he took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it no we dont keep a cat but there is a cheetah and a baboon ah yes of course well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention thank you that is quite settled said he rising and putting his lens in his pocket hullo here is something interesting the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed the lash however was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord what do you make of that watson that is not quite so common is it ah me its a wicked world and permission we shall walk out upon the lawn when we turned from the scene of this investigation we had walked several times up and down the lawn neither miss stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his absolutely follow my advice in every respect the matter is too serious for any hesitation your life may depend upon your compliance inn over there yes that is the crown you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather comes back then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to there for one night oh yes easily the rest you will leave in our hands but what will you do we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you miss stoner laying her hand upon my companions sleeve then for pitys sake tell me what was the cause of my sisters you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and if she died from some sudden fright tangible cause and now miss stoner we must leave you for if dr roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain goodbye and that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you our window we could command a view of the avenue gate and of the inhabited wing of stoke moran manor house at dusk we saw dr grimesby roylott drive past his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him the boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctors voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him the trap drove on and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sittingrooms do you know watson said holmes as we sat together in the gathering is a distinct element of danger your presence might be invaluable you speak of danger you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me you saw the ventilator too hardly pass through my dear holmes could smell dr roylotts cigar now of course that suggested at once be a small one or it would have been remarked upon at the coroners but what harm can there be in that well there is at least a curious coincidence of dates a ventilator is made a cord is hung and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies does not that strike you did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed relative position to the ventilator and to the ropeor so we may call it since it was clearly never meant for a bellpull only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime subtle enough and horrible enough when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals he has nerve and he has knowledge palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession this man strikes deeper still but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over for goodness sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful about nine oclock the light among the trees was extinguished and all was dark in the direction of the manor house two hours passed slowly away and then suddenly just at the stroke of eleven a single bright light shone out right in front of us that is our signal said holmes springing to his feet it comes from the middle window as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance and that it was possible that we might spend the night there a moment later we were out on the dark road a chill wind blowing in our faces and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand there was little difficulty in entering the grounds for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall making our way among the trees we reached the lawn crossed it and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the upon my wrist in his agitation then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear cheetah too perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any bedroom my companion noiselessly closed the shutters moved the lamp onto the table and cast his eyes round the room all was as we had seen it in the daytime then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that the least sound would be fatal to our plans we must sit without light he would see it through the ventilator do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it have your pistol you in that chair holmes had brought up a long thin cane and this he placed upon the bed beside him by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle then he turned down the lamp and we were left in darkness openeyed within a few feet of me in the same state of nervous light and we waited in absolute darkness from outside came the occasional cry of a nightbird and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock which boomed out every quarter of an hour how long they seemed those quarters twelve struck and one and two and three and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator which vanished immediately but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal someone in the next room all was silent once more though the smell grew stronger for half an audiblea very gentle soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle the instant that we heard it holmes sprang from the bed struck a match and lashed furiously with his cane at the bellpull you see it watson he yelled you see it low clear whistle but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed filled with horror and loathing he had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the up louder and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek they say that away down in the village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the gazing at holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose all it is for the best take your pistol and we will enter dr roylotts room with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within then pistol in my hand darklantern with the shutter half open throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar beside this table on the wooden chair sat dr grimesby roylott clad in a long grey dressinggown his bare ankles protruding beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with brownish speckles which seemed to be bound tightly round his head as we entered he made neither sound nor motion the band the speckled band whispered holmes move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamondshaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another let us thrust this creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened as he spoke he drew the dogwhip swiftly from the dead mans lap and throwing the noose round the reptiles neck he drew it from its horrid perch and carrying it at arms length threw it into the iron safe which he closed upon it such are the true facts of the death of dr grimesby roylott of stoke already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day shows my dear watson how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data the presence of the gipsies and the use of the word band which was used by the poor girl no doubt to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of when however it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door this ventilator and to the bellrope which hung down to the bed the discovery that this was a dummy and that the bed was clamped to the floor instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of the idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern training the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also from his point could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim he had trained it probably by the use of the milk which we saw to return to him when summoned he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best with the certainty that it bite the occupant perhaps she might escape every night for a week but sooner or later she must fall a victim inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant having once made up my mind you know the the light and attacked it with the result of driving it through the ventilator and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend mr sherlock holmes for solution during the years of our intimacy there of mr hatherleys thumb and that of colonel warburtons madness of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable newspapers but like all such narratives its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single halfcolumn of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth at the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker street persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come and visit lingering disease was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from guard came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him hes all right strange creature which he had caged up in my room he went this trusty tout without even giving me time to thank him he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped which was mottled all over with bloodstains he masculine face but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation which it took all his strength of mind to control oh my night could not be called monotonous said he and laughed he laughed very heartily with a high ringing note leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides all my medical instincts rose up against that laugh water from a caraffe outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone presently he came to himself once more very weary and colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks thats better said he and now doctor perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb or rather to the place where my thumb used to be hardened nerves a shudder to look at it there were four protruding fingers and a horrid red spongy surface where the thumb should have the wrist and braced it up with a twig excellent you should have been a surgeon sharp instrument a thing like a cleaver said he by no means what a murderous attack you horrify me over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages he lay back without wincing though he bit his lip from time to time to your nerves between ourselves if it were not for the convincing evidence of this with which to back it up and even if they believe me the clues which be done friend mr sherlock holmes before you go to the official police use the official police as well would you give me an introduction to well call a cab and go together we shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him do you feel equal to it and in five minutes was inside a hansom driving with my new acquaintance to baker street his dressinggown reading the agony column of the times and smoking his beforebreakfast pipe which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece he received us in his quietly genial fashion ordered fresh rashers and eggs and joined us in a hearty meal when it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa placed a pillow beneath his head and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach hatherley said he pray lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home tell us what you can but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary heavylidded expression and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us of greenwich two years ago having served my time and having also determined to start in business for myself and took professional a dreary experience to me it has been exceptionally so during two absolutely all that my profession has brought me my gross takings amount to s every day from nine in the morning until four in clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business he brought up a card too with the name of colonel lysander stark engraved upon it close at his heels came the colonel himself a man rather over the middle size but of an exceeding face sharpened away into nose and chin and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit and due to no disease for his eye was bright his step brisk and his bearing assured he was plainly but mr hatherley said he with something of a german accent you have been recommended to me mr hatherley as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret and a bachelor and are residing alone in london you wished to speak to me is quite essentialabsolute secrecy you understand and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family upon my doing so never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye do you promise then said he at last absolute and complete silence before during and after no reference to the matter at all either in word or writing the room he flung open the door the passage outside was empty sometimes curious as to their masters affairs now we can talk in safety he drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look a feeling of repulsion and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my value heaven forgive me for that last sentence but the words came to my lips how would fifty guineas for a nights work suit you he asked most admirably simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has right ourselves what do you think of such a commission as that the work appears to be light and the pay munificent precisely so we shall want you to come tonight by the last train where to oxfordshire and within seven miles of reading there is a train from paddington which would bring you there at about there is a drive then miles from eyford station yes we could easily give you a shakedown you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you a young and unknown man a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession still of course if you would like to draw out of the business there is plenty of time to do so more clearly what it is that you wish me to do suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers then the matter stands thus you are probably aware that fullersearth is a valuable product and that it is only found in one or two places in england a deposit of fullersearth in one of my fields on examining it that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and leftboth of them however in the grounds of my neighbours these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a goldmine naturally it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value but of my friends into the secret however and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields this we have now been doing for some time and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press this your advice upon the subject we guard our secret very jealously however and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house it would soon rouse inquiry and then if the facts came out it would be goodbye to any chance of getting these me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to eyford understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in gravel from a pit ah said he carelessly we have our own process we compress the earth into bricks so as to remove them without revealing what they and not a word to a soul he looked at me with a last long questioning gaze and then pressing my hand in a cold dank grasp he hurried from the room astonished as you may both think at this sudden commission which had upon my own services and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones on the other hand the face and manner of my patron had explanation of the fullersearth was sufficient to explain the winds ate a hearty supper drove to paddington and started off having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue who got out there and there was no one upon the platform save a single upon the other side without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage the door of which was standing open he drew up the windows on either side tapped on the woodwork and away we went as fast as the horse could go one horse interjected holmes yes only one did you observe the colour tiredlooking or fresh oh fresh and glossy interesting statement away we went then and we drove for at least an hour colonel lysander the rate that we seemed to go and from the time that we took that it must have been nearer twelve he sat at my side in silence all the that he was looking at me with great intensity the country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world for we lurched and out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light now and the colonel answered only in monosyllables and the conversation soon flagged at last however the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a graveldrive and the carriage came to a pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us we stepped failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house the drove away looking for matches and muttering under his breath suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage and a long golden bar of light lamp in her hand which she held above her head pushing her face was a rich material she spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand colonel stark went up to her whispered something in her ear and then pushing her back into the room from whence she had come he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few plainly furnished room with a round table in the centre on which several german books were scattered colonel stark laid down the lamp waiting an instant said he and vanished into the darkness silent house there was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage but otherwise everything was deadly still a vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me who were these german people and what were they doing living in this strange outoftheway place and matter reading and possibly other large towns were within that radius so the place might not be so secluded after all yet it was quite certain from the absolute stillness that we were in the fiftyguinea fee suddenly without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness the door of my room swung slowly open the woman was standing in the aperture the darkness of the hall behind her the could see at a glance that she was sick with fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart she held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent and she shot a few whispered words of broken english at me her eyes glancing back like those of a frightened horse into the gloom behind her to do shook my head she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward with her hands wrung together for the love of heaven she whispered get away from here before it is too late fiftyguinea fee of my wearisome journey and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me was it all to go for nothing why should monomaniac with a stout bearing therefore though her manner had her entreaties when a door slammed overhead and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs she listened for an instant threw up her hands with a despairing gesture and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come the newcomers were colonel lysander stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin who was introduced to me as mr ferguson that you have felt the draught the room to be a little close he shot one of his suspicious looks at me perhaps we had better up to see the machine oh no it is in the house what you dig fullersearth in the house no no this is only where we compress it but never mind that all we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it we went upstairs together the colonel first with the lamp the fat corridors passages narrow winding staircases and little low doors the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor while the plaster was peeling off the walls and the eye upon my two companions ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent a fellowcountryman colonel lysander stark stopped at last before a low door which he unlocked within was a small square room in which the three of us could hardly get at one time ferguson remained outside and the colonel ushered me in we are now said he actually within the hydraulic press and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you the machine goes readily enough but there is some stiffness in the working of it and it has lost a little of its force perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right was a slight leakage which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders an examination showed that one of the indiarubber bands which was round the head of a drivingrod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked this was companions who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right when obvious at a glance that the story of the fullersearth was the merest fabrication for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose the walls were of heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me what are you doing there he asked speech his face set hard and a baleful light sprang up in his grey a step backward slammed the little door and turned the key in the secure and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves hullo leaking cylinder he had set the engine at work the lamp still stood jerkily but as none knew better than myself with a force which must implored the colonel to let me out but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries the ceiling was only a foot or two above my then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me brought a gush of hope back to my heart of yellow light between two of the boards which broadened and hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death other side the panel had closed again behind me but the crash of the lamp and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal told me how narrow had been my escape found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand while she held so foolishly rejected come come she cried breathlessly they will be here in a moment they will see that you are not there oh do not waste the soprecious time but come feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair the latter led to another broad passage and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath my guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wits end then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom through the window of which the moon was shining brightly you can jump it as she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butchers window and looked out how quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight and it could not be more than thirty feet should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who go back to her assistance the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door pushing his way past her but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back fritz fritz she cried in english remember your promise after the last time you said it should not be again he will be silent oh he will be silent you are mad elise he shouted struggling to break away from her he dashed her to one side and rushing to the window cut at me with hand which was throbbing painfully and then for the first time saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my the rosebushes very long time for the moon had sunk and a bright morning was and my coatsleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb the smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my nights lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad and just a little lower down was a long building which proved upon my approaching it were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream there would be one to reading in less than an hour the same porter was whether he had ever heard of colonel lysander stark the name was strange to him had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me no he had not was there a policestation anywhere near there was one about three miles off put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise we both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative then sherlock holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his appeared in all the papers about a year ago listen to this lost on the th inst mr jeremiah hayling aged twentysix a hydraulic engineer left his lodgings at ten oclock at night and has not been heard of since was dressed in etc etc ha that represents the good heavens cried my patient then that explains what the girl desperate man who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game like those outandout pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship well every moment now is precious so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to scotland yard at once as a preliminary to starting for eyford some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together bound from reading to the little berkshire village there were sherlock a plainclothes man and myself bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with eyford for its centre there you are said he that circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village the place we want must be somewhere near that and you think that they brought you back all that way when you were lifted and conveyed somewhere when they found you lying fainting in the garden perhaps the villain was softened by the womans entreaties that we are in search of are to be found really now cried the inspector you have formed your opinion country is more deserted there quiet little villages up there our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any come cried the inspector laughing its a very pretty diversity of opinion we have boxed the compass among us who do you give your casting vote to you are all wrong but we cant all be oh yes you can this is my point he placed his finger in the centre of the circle this is where we shall find them but the twelvemile drive gasped hatherley six out and six back nothing simpler you say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in how could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang none at all said holmes they are coiners on a large scale and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of we have known for some time that a clever gang was at work said the inspector they have been turning out halfcrowns by the thousand we even traced them as far as reading but could get no farther for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old them right enough but the inspector was mistaken for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice as we rolled into eyford station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape a house on fire asked bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way yes sir said the stationmaster when did it break out the whole place is in a blaze whose house is it dr bechers tell me broke in the engineer is dr becher a german very thin with a long sharp nose the stationmaster laughed heartily no sir dr becher is an englishman and there isnt a man in the parish who has a betterlined understand who is a foreigner and he looks as if a little good berkshire beef would do him no harm the stationmaster had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire the road topped a low hill and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us spouting fire at every chink and window while in the garden in front three fireengines were vainly striving to keep the flames under thats it cried hatherley in intense excitement there is the well at least said holmes you have had your revenge upon them there can be no question that it was your oillamp which when it was crushed in the press set fire to the wooden walls though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night and holmes fears came to be realised for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman the sinister german or the morose englishman early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of reading but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared and even holmes ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a windowsill of the second floor about sunset however their efforts were at last successful and they subdued the flames but not before the roof had fallen in and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that save some twisted cylinders and iron piping not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an outhouse but no coins were to be found which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould which told us a very plain tale he had evidently been carried down by two persons one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones on the whole it was most probable that the silent englishman being less bold or less murderous than his companion had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger well said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once you know you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence the lord st simon marriage and its curious termination have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves fresh scandals have eclipsed it and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this full facts have never been revealed to the general public and as my friend sherlock holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter sketch of this remarkable episode still sharing rooms with holmes in baker street that he came home from had remained indoors all day for the weather had taken a sudden turn brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence with my body in one easychair and my aside and lay listless watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friends noble correspondent could be yes my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety he answered smiling and the humbler are usually the more interesting this looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie he broke the seal and glanced over the contents oh come it may prove to be something of interest after all not social then no distinctly professional and from a noble client one of the highest in england client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case new investigation you have been reading the papers diligently of late have you not nothing except the criminal news and the agony column the latter is always instructive but if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about lord st simon and his wedding oh yes with the deepest interest papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter this is what he determined therefore to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding mr lestrade of scotland yard is acting already in the matter but he assures me that he sees no objection to your cooperation and that he even thinks that it afternoon and should you have any other engagement at that time importance yours faithfully noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger remarked holmes as he folded up the subject turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order redcovered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece here he is said he sitting down and flattening it out of the duke of balmoral hum arms azure three caltrops in chief over a fess sable born in hes fortyone years of age which is mature for marriage was undersecretary for the colonies in a late administration the duke his father was at one time secretary for foreign affairs they inherit plantagenet blood by direct descent and tudor on the distaff side ha well there is nothing very instructive on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters oh you mean the little problem of the grosvenor square furniture van that is quite cleared up nowthough indeed it was obvious from the first pray give me the results of your newspaper selections column of the morning post and dates as you see some weeks back a marriage has been arranged it says and will if rumour is correct very shortly take place between lord robert st simon second son of the duke of balmoral and miss hatty doran the only daughter of aloysius doran esq of san francisco cal usa that is all terse and to the point remarked holmes stretching his long thin legs towards the fire there was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week ah here it is there will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market for the present freetrade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product one by one the management of the noble houses of great britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic an important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders lord st simon who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little gods arrows has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with miss hatty doran the fascinating daughter of a california millionaire miss doran whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the westbury house festivities is an only child and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures with expectancies for the future as it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years and as lord st simon has no property of his own save the small estate of birchmoor it is obvious that the californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a republican lady to a british peeress anything else asked holmes yawning oh yes plenty then there is another note in the morning post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one that it would be at st georges hanover square that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited and that the party would return to the furnished house at lancaster gate which has been taken by mr aloysius doran two days laterthat is on wednesday lastthere is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place and that the honeymoon would be passed at lord backwaters place near petersfield those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride before the what asked holmes with a start the vanishing of the lady when did she vanish then at the wedding breakfast dramatic in fact yes it struck me as being a little out of the common they often vanish before the ceremony and occasionally during the pray let me have the details perhaps we may make them less so such as they are they are set forth in a single article of a morning occurrence at a fashionable wedding the family of lord robert st simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding the ceremony as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday occurred on the previous morning but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange attempts of the friends to hush the matter up so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation the ceremony which was performed at st georges hanover square was a very quiet one no one being present save the father of the bride mr aloysius doran the duchess of balmoral lord backwater lord eustace and lady clara st simon the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom and lady alicia whittington the whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of mr aloysius doran at lancaster trouble was caused by a woman whose name has not been ascertained who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman the bride who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption had sat down to breakfast with the rest when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room her prolonged absence having caused some comment her father followed her but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant caught up an ulster and bonnet and hurried down to the passage one of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled but had refused to credit that it was his mistress believing her to be with the company on ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared mr aloysius doran in conjunction with the bridegroom instantly put themselves in communication with the police and very energetic inquiries are being made which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business up to a late hour last night however nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady there are rumours of foul play in the matter and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance in the belief that from jealousy or some other motive she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride and is that all only one little item in another of the morning papers but it is a suggestive one and it is that miss flora millar the lady who had caused the disturbance has at the allegro and that she has known the bridegroom for some years there are no further particulars and the whole case is in your hands nowso far as it has been set forth in the public press missed it for worlds but there is a ring at the bell watson and as very much prefer having a witness if only as a check to my own lord robert st simon announced our pageboy throwing open the door a gentleman entered with a pleasant cultured face highnosed and pale with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth and with the steady wellopened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed his manner was brisk and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked his hair too as he swept off his very curlybrimmed hat was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top as to his dress it was careful to the verge of foppishness with high collar black frockcoat white waistcoat yellow gloves patentleather shoes and lightcoloured gaiters he advanced slowly into the room turning his head from left to right and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden goodday lord st simon said holmes rising and bowing pray take the basketchair this is my friend and colleague dr watson draw up a little to the fire and we will talk this matter over a most painful matter to me as you can most readily imagine mr presume that they were hardly from the same class of society my last client of the sort was a king the king of scandinavia what had he lost his wife forming an opinion example as to the disappearance of the bride lord st simon glanced over it yes it is correct as far as it but it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer questioning you pray do so when did you first meet miss hatty doran you were travelling in the states did you become engaged then but you were on a friendly footing her father is very rich he is said to be the richest man on the pacific slope and how did he make his money invested it and came up by leaps and bounds now what is your own impression as to the young ladysyour wifes the nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire you see mr holmes said he my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man during that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains so that her education has come from nature rather than from the schoolmaster she is what we call in england a tomboy with a strong nature wild and free unfettered by she is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her capable of heroic selfsacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her have you her photograph miniature and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair the large dark eyes and the exquisite mouth holmes gazed long and earnestly at it then he closed the locket and handed it back to lord st simon the young lady came to london then and you renewed your her several times became engaged to her and have now married her a fair dowry not more than is usual in my family and this of course remains to you since the marriage is a fait was she in good spirits never better she kept talking of what we should do in our future she was as bright as possibleat least until after the ceremony and did you observe any change in her then seen that her temper was just a little sharp the incident however was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case pray let us have it for all that oh it is childish she dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry she was passing the front pew at the time and it fell over into the pew there was a moments delay but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again and it did not appear to be the worse for abruptly and in the carriage on our way home she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause general public were present then this gentleman was not one of your wifes friends think that we are wandering rather far from the point lady st simon then returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it what did she do on reentering her fathers house and who is her maid alice is her name she is an american and came from california with a confidential servant take great liberties still of course in america they look upon these things in a different way how long did she speak to this alice you did not overhear what they said lady st simon said something about jumping a claim she was american slang is very expressive sometimes and what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid she walked into the breakfastroom on your arm no alone she was very independent in little matters like that then after we had sat down for ten minutes or so she rose hurriedly muttered some words of apology and left the room she never came room covered her brides dress with a long ulster put on a bonnet and went out quite so and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in company with flora millar a woman who is now in custody and who had already made a disturbance at mr dorans house that morning your relations to her lord st simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows we have ungenerously and she had no just cause of complaint against me but you know what women are mr holmes flora was a dear little thing but exceedingly hotheaded and devotedly attached to me she wrote me to mr dorans door just after we returned and she endeavoured to push her way in uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife and even pushed her out again she was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row did your wife hear all this no thank goodness she did not and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards yes that is what mr lestrade of scotland yard looks upon as so terrible trap for her well it is a possible supposition you think so too as likely still jealousy is a strange transformer of characters pray what is your own theory as to what took place has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife say upon me but upon so much that many have aspired to without well certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis said holmes you could see out of the window we could see the other side of the road and the park shall communicate with you should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem said our client rising eh what was that where then is my wife heads than yours or mine he remarked and bowing in a stately oldfashioned manner he departed shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this our client came into the room my dear holmes before which were quite as prompt my whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing as when you find a trout in the milk to quote thoreaus example without however the knowledge of preexisting cases which serves me so well there was a parallel instance in aberdeen some years back and something on very much the same lines at munich the year after the lestrade goodafternoon lestrade you will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard and there are cigars in the box the official detective was attired in a peajacket and cravat which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand with a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him whats up then asked holmes with a twinkle in his eye you look really you surprise me who ever heard of such a mixed affair every clue seems to slip and very wet it seems to have made you said holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the peajacket sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily have you dragged the basin of trafalgar square fountain he asked why what do you mean because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other about it he snarled oh indeed then you think that the serpentine plays no part in the then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it he opened his bag as he spoke and tumbled onto the floor a weddingdress of watered silk a pair of white satin shoes and a brides wreath and veil all discoloured and soaked in water there said he putting a new weddingring upon the top of the pile there is a little nut for you to crack master holmes oh indeed said my friend blowing blue rings into the air you dragged them from the serpentine no they were found floating near the margin by a parkkeeper they have been identified as her clothes and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off by the same brilliant reasoning every mans body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe and pray what did you hope to arrive at through this at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance afraid holmes that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences you have made two blunders in as many minutes this dress does implicate miss flora millar and how cardcase is a note and here is the very note he slapped it down upon the table in front of him listen to this you will see me when all is ready come at once f h m now my theory all along has been that lady st simon was decoyed away by flora millar and that she with confederates no doubt was responsible for her disappearance here signed with her initials is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach indeed let me see it he took up the paper in a listless way but his attention instantly became riveted and he gave a little cry of satisfaction this is indeed important said he ha you find it so lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look why he shrieked youre looking at the wrong side on the contrary this is the right side the right side youre mad here is the note written in pencil over and over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill which interests me deeply th rooms s breakfast s d cocktail s lunch s you again work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories goodday mr holmes and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first he gathered up the garments thrust them into the bag and made for the door just one hint to you lestrade drawled holmes before his rival simon is a myth there is not and there never has been any such lestrade looked sadly at my companion then he turned to me tapped his forehead three times shook his head solemnly and hurried away he had hardly shut the door behind him when holmes rose to put on his overcoat there is something in what the fellow says about outdoor papers for a little time to be lonely for within an hour there arrived a confectioners man with a very large flat box this he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him and presently to my very great astonishment a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodginghouse mahogany there were a couple of brace of cold woodcock a pheasant a pt de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles having laid out all these luxuries my two visitors vanished away like the genii of the arabian nights with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address just before nine oclock sherlock holmes stepped briskly into the room his features were gravely set but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions they have laid the supper then he said rubbing his hands you seem to expect company they have laid for five dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features my messenger reached you then asked holmes you good authority for what you say the best possible lord st simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead what will the duke say he murmured when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation ah you look on these things from another standpoint could have acted otherwise though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted having no mother she had no one to advise her at such a crisis his fingers upon the table you must make allowance for this poor girl placed in so unprecedented a position shamefully used successful he opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman lord st simon said he allow me to introduce you to mr and mrs at the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frockcoat a picture of offended dignity the lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him but he perhaps for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist to be pray make no apology to me said lord st simon bitterly there before the altar perhaps mrs moulton you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter just a little too much secrecy over this business already for my part a small wiry sunburnt man cleanshaven with a sharp face and alert met in in mcquires camp near the rockies where pa was working a father struck a rich pocket and made a pile while poor frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing the richer pa grew the poorer was frank so at last pa wouldnt hear of our engagement lasting any longer and he took me away to frisco frank wouldnt throw up his hand though so he followed me there and he saw me without pa knowing fixed it all up for ourselves frank said that he would go and make his pile too and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa myself not to marry anyone else while he lived why shouldnt we be talked it over and he had fixed it all up so nicely with a clergyman all ready in waiting that we just did it right there and then frank that came a long newspaper story about how a miners camp had been frank was really dead then lord st simon came to frisco and we came felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor frank to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a round and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee my bouquet over to him and he slipped the note into my hand when he he might direct lord st simon but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all out of the window at the other side of the road he beckoned to me and followed him some woman came talking something or other about lord st her and soon overtook frank we got into a cab together and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting frank had been a prisoner among the apaches had escaped came on to frisco found that and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding the church but not where the lady lived then we had a talk as to what we should do and frank was all for like to vanish away and never see any of them againjust sending a line think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfasttable and waiting for me to come back so frank took my weddingclothes and that we should have gone on to paris tomorrow only that this good gentleman mr holmes came round to us this evening though how he putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret then he offered to give us a chance of talking to lord st simon alone and so we came right away round to his rooms at once now robert you have heard it do not think very meanly of me lord st simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long excuse me he said but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner oh certainly if it would give you any pleasure he put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him friendly supper all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room blundering of a minister in fargone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same worldwide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the union jack with the stars and stripes the case has been an interesting one remarked holmes when our visitors had left us because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady and nothing stranger than the result when viewed for instance by mr lestrade of scotland you were not yourself at fault at all then from the first two facts were very obvious to me the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home obviously something had occurred during the morning then to cause her to change her mind what could that something be she could not have spoken to anyone when she was out for she had been in the company of someone from america because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely you see we have already arrived by a process of exclusion at the idea that she might have seen an american then who could this american be and why should he possess so much simons narrative when he told us of a man in a pew of the change in the brides manner of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet of her resort to her confidential maid and of her very significant allusion to claimjumpingwhich in miners parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim tothe whole situation became absolutely clear she had gone off with a man and the man was either a lover or was a previous husbandthe chances being in favour of the latter and how in the world did you find them his hands the value of which he did not himself know the initials were of course of the highest importance but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select london hotels how did you deduce the select by the select prices eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels there are book that francis h moulton an american gentleman had left only the them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to lord st simon in particular not very gracious ah watson said holmes smiling perhaps you would not be very gracious either if after all the trouble of wooing and wedding you that we may judge lord st simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position draw your chair up and hand me my violin for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings his relatives should allow him to come out alone my friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the bright crisp february morning and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground shimmering brightly in the wintry sun down the centre of baker street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic but at either side and on the heapedup edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell the grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped but was still dangerously slippery so of the metropolitan station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention he was a man of about fifty tall portly and imposing with a massive strongly marked face and a commanding figure he was dressed in a sombre yet rich style in black frockcoat shining hat neat brown gaiters and wellcut pearlgrey trousers yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features for he was running hard with occasional little springs such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs as he ran he jerked his hands up and down waggled his head and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions at the numbers of the houses the man puffing and blowing rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging a few moments later he was in our room still puffing still gesticulating but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity for a while he could not get his words out but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason then suddenly springing to his feet he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room sherlock holmes pushed him down into the easychair and sitting beside him patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ you have come to me to tell your story have you not said he you are fatigued with your haste pray wait until you have recovered problem which you may submit to me the man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest fighting against his emotion then he passed his handkerchief over his brow set his lips tight and turned his face towards us no doubt you think me mad said he private affliction also is the lot of every man but the two coming together and in so frightful a form have been enough to shake my very suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair pray compose yourself sir said holmes and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you am alexander holder of the banking firm of holder stevenson of threadneedle street the name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the city of london what could have happened then to bring one of the foremost citizens of london to this most pitiable pass we waited all curiosity until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story from there on foot for the cabs go slowly through this snow that is business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors one of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans where the security is unimpeachable we have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures libraries or plate had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earthone of the highest noblest most exalted names entered to say so but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task of advancing money understand that it is unwise to place ones self under obligations certainly repay what you advance with whatever interest you think it right to charge but it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once even in your case every businesslike precaution should be taken black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair you have doubtless heard of the beryl coronet precisely he opened the case and there imbedded in soft fleshcoloured velvet lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named there are thirtynine enormous beryls said he and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable the lowest estimate would prepared to leave it with you as my security from it to my illustrious client you doubt its value he asked the propriety of my leaving it you may set your mind at rest about gossip upon the matter but above all to preserve this coronet with scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss for there are no beryls in the world to match these and it would be impossible to the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me there could be no doubt that as it was a national possession a horrible scandal would ever consented to take charge of it however it was too late to alter more to my work precious a thing in the office behind me bankers safes had been backward and forward with me so that it might never be really out of thoroughly understand the situation my groom and my page sleep out of who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion another lucy parr the second waitingmaid has only been in my service a few months she came with an excellent character however and has always given me satisfaction she is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place that is the only drawback which we have found to her but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way so much for the servants my family itself is so small that it will arthur he has been a disappointment to me mr holmesa grievous business but he was not of a business turn he was wild wayward and of money when he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club and there having charming manners he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits he learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance that he might settle his debts of honour he tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping but each time the influence of his friend sir george burnwell was enough to draw him back again should gain an influence over him for he has frequently brought him to fascination of his manner he is older than arthur a man of the world to his fingertips one who had been everywhere seen everything a and so too thinks my little mary who has a womans quick insight into character and now there is only she to be described she is my niece but when adopted her and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter she is a sunbeam in my housesweet loving beautiful a wonderful manager and housekeeper yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes twice my boy has asked her to marry him for he loves her devotedly but each time she right path it would have been she and that his marriage might have changed his whole life but now alas it is too lateforever too late shall continue with my miserable story when we were taking coffee in the drawingroom that night after treasure which we had under our roof suppressing only the name of my thought it better not to disturb it where have you put it asked arthur night said he opened it myself with the key of the boxroom cupboard he said he followed me to my room however that night with a very grave face look here dad said he with his eyes cast down can you let me you in money matters yes but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man said he the room without another word you give lucy the maid leave to go out tonight certainly not hardly safe and should be stopped you sure that everything is fastened quite sure dad on the contrary your statement is singularly lucid mind tended no doubt to make me even less so than usual about two in my ears suddenly to my horror there was a distinct sound of palpitating with fear and peeped round the corner of my dressingroom only in his shirt and trousers was standing beside the light holding the coronet in his hands he appeared to be wrenching at it or bending it with all his strength at my cry he dropped it from his grasp and gold corners with three of the beryls in it was missing destroyed it you have dishonoured me forever where are the jewels which you have stolen stolen he cried there are none missing there cannot be any missing said he make my own way in the world police let the police find what they can my anger mary was the first to rush into my room and at the sight of the coronet and of arthurs face she read the whole story and with a police and put the investigation into their hands at once when the inspector and a constable entered the house arthur who had stood sullenly with his arms folded asked me whether it was my intention to matter but had become a public one since the ruined coronet was five minutes that you may get away or perhaps that you may conceal what you have to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation he might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing but make such reparation as is in your power by telling us where the beryls are all shall be forgiven and forgotten keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it he answered turning inspector and gave him into custody a search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems but no trace of them could be found nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats this morning he was removed to a cell and to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter the police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of he put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words sherlock holmes sat silent for some few minutes with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire do you receive much company he asked none save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of arthurs sir george burnwell has been several times lately no one do you go out much in society that is unusual in a young girl she is of a quiet nature besides she is not so very young she is this matter from what you say seems to have been a shock to her you have neither of you any doubt as to your sons guilt his hands coronet at all injured yes it was twisted do you not think then that he might have been trying to straighten god bless you you are doing what you can for him and for me but it were innocent why did he not say so precisely and if it were guilty why did he not invent a lie his silence appears to me to cut both ways there are several singular points about the case what did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep they considered that it might be caused by arthurs closing his bedroom door a likely story as if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household what did they say then of the disappearance of these gems they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them have they thought of looking outside the house yes they have shown extraordinary energy the whole garden has already been minutely examined now my dear sir said holmes is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the simple case to me it seems exceedingly complex consider what is involved by your theory you suppose that your son came down from his bed went at great risk to your dressingroom opened your bureau took out your coronet broke off by main force a small portion of it went off to some other place concealed three gems out of the thirtynine with such skill that nobody can find them and then returned with the other thirtysix into the room in which he exposed such a theory tenable but what other is there cried the banker with a gesture of despair please mr holder we will set off for streatham together and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details my friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition which of the bankers son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation he hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes sunk in the deepest thought our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs a short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to fairbank the modest residence of the great financier fairbank was a goodsized square house of white stone standing back a little from the road a double carriagesweep with a snowclad lawn stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance on the right side was a small wooden thicket which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door and forming the tradesmens entrance on the left ran a lane which led to the stables and was not itself within the grounds at all being a public though little used thoroughfare holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house across the front down the tradesmens path and so round by the garden behind the diningroom and waited by the fire until he should return we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in she was rather above the middle height slim with dark hair and eyes her lips too were bloodless but her eyes were flushed with crying as she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character with immense capacity for selfrestraint disregarding my presence she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress you have given orders that arthur should be liberated have you not dad she asked no no my girl the matter must be probed to the bottom having acted so harshly why is he silent then if he is innocent who knows perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect coronet in his hand oh but he had only picked it up to look at it oh do do take my word for it that he is innocent let the matter drop and say no more affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me far to inquire more deeply into it this gentleman she asked facing round to me no his friend he wished us to leave him alone he is round in the stable lane now the stable lane she raised her dark eyebrows what can he hope to arthur is innocent of this crime it returned holmes going back to the mat to knock the snow from his pray do sir if it may help to clear this horrible affair up you heard nothing yourself last night you shut up the windows and doors the night before did you fasten all the windows were they all fastened this morning your uncle last night that she had been out to see him yes and she was the girl who waited in the drawingroom and who may have heard uncles remarks about the coronet and that the two may have planned the robbery but what is the good of all these vague theories cried the banker in his hands wait a little mr holder we must come back to that about this girl do you know him oh yes he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round his name is francis prosper he stood said holmes to the left of the doorthat is to say farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door yes he did and he is a man with a wooden leg something like fear sprang up in the young ladys expressive black eyes why you are like a magician said she how do you know that she smiled but there was no answering smile in holmes thin eager he walked swiftly round from one to the other pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane this he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens now we shall go upstairs said he at last the bankers dressingroom was a plainly furnished little chamber with a grey carpet a large bureau and a long mirror holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock which key was used to open it he asked that which my son himself indicatedthat of the cupboard of the have you it here that is it on the dressingtable sherlock holmes took it up and opened the bureau look at it he opened the case and taking out the diadem he laid it side of the coronet was a cracked edge where a corner holding three gems had been torn away now mr holder said holmes here is the corner which corresponds break it off exceptionally strong in the fingers it would take me all my time to break it an ordinary man could not do it now what do you think would pistol shot do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it but perhaps it may grow lighter as we go what do you think miss your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him he had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt thank you we have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not shall now continue my investigations outside he went alone at his own request for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult for an hour or more he was at work returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever but the gems mr holmes where are they and my son you give me hopes my opinion is in no way altered then for gods sake what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night before evening to sound him upon the point but he always glided away to some other when we found ourselves in our rooms once more he hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer with his collar turned up his shiny seedy coat his red cravat and his worn boots he was a perfect sample of the class the joint upon the sideboard sandwiched it between two rounds of bread and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition spirits swinging an old elasticsided boot in his hand he chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea where to how are you getting on clothes off and return to my highly respectable self than his words alone would imply his eyes twinkled and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks he hastened upstairs and a he was off once more upon his congenial hunt days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent so that his cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other as fresh and trim as possible you will excuse my beginning without you watson said he but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning which had come over him for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould was now pinched and fallen in while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter he entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before comes close upon the heels of another my niece mary has deserted deserted you yes her bed this morning had not been slept in her room was empty night in sorrow and not in anger that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say forever do not worry about my future for that is provided for and above all do not search for me for it will be fruitless your loving what could she mean by that note mr holmes do you think it points to suicide ha you say so you have heard something mr holmes you have learned something where are the gems you would not think apiece an excessive sum for them that would be unnecessary three thousand will cover the matter and pen better make it out for with a dazed face the banker made out the required check holmes walked over to his desk took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it and threw it down upon the table with a shriek of joy our client clutched it up the reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom there is one other thing you owe mr holder said sherlock holmes rather sternly no the debt is not to me you owe a very humble apology to that noble then it was not arthur who took them you are sure of it then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known few details which were not yet quite clear to me your news of this morning however may open his lips for heavens sake tell me then what is this extraordinary mystery let me say to you first that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear there has been an understanding between sir george burnwell and your niece mary they have now fled together your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle he is one of the most dangerous men in englanda ruined gambler an absolutely desperate villain a man without heart or conscience your niece knew nothing of such men when he breathed his vows to her as he had done to a hundred before her she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart the devil knows best what he said but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening niece when you had as she thought gone to your room slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane his footmarks had pressed right through the snow so long had he stood there she told him of the coronet his wicked lust for gold she loved you but there are women in whom the love of a lover she had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants escapade with her woodenlegged lover which was all perfectly true your boy arthur went to bed after his interview with you but he middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door so he rose and looking out was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressingroom petrified with astonishment the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair presently she emerged from the room again and in the light of the passagelamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands she passed down the stairs and he thrilling with horror ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath he saw her stealthily open the window hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom and then closing it once more hurry back to her room passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved but the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you and how allimportant it was to set it right he rushed down just as he was in his bare feet opened the window sprang out into the snow and ran down the lane where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight sir george burnwell tried to get away but arthur caught him and there was a struggle between them your lad tugging at one your son struck sir george and cut him over the eye then something suddenly snapped and your son finding that he had the coronet in his hands rushed back closed the window ascended to your room and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene you then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks he could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands he took the more chivalrous view however and preserved her secret and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes the dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle how carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow before and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve trampled down and indistinguishable just beyond it however at the far side of the kitchen door a woman had stood and talked with a man could even tell that they had been disturbed for the woman had run back swiftly to the door as was shown by the deep toe and light heel thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart of passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of there was a double line of tracks of a booted man and a second double at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son the first had walked both ways but the other had run swiftly and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot it found they led to the hall window where boots had worn all the snow the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle and finally mistaken boots had then run down the lane and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt when he came to the so there was an end to that clue beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred a man had waited outside the window someone had brought the gems the deed had been overseen by your son he had pursued the thief had struggled with him they had each tugged at the coronet their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected he had returned with the prize but had left a fragment in the grasp of his who was it brought him the coronet that it was not you who had brought it down so there only remained your niece and the maids but if it were the maids why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place there could be no possible reason as he loved his cousin however there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secretthe more so as the secret window and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again my conjecture became a certainty and who could it be who was her confederate a lover evidently for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems even though he knew that arthur had discovered him he might still flatter himself that he was safe for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family went in the shape of a loafer to sir georges house managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet learned that his master had cut his head the night before and finally at the expense of six shillings journeyed down to streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the him a price for the stones he held apiece that brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown why dash it all said he the address of the receiver who had them on promising him that there him that all was right and eventually got to my bed about two oclock a day which has saved england from a great public scandal said the not find me ungrateful for what you have done your skill has indeed tell me of poor mary it goes to my very heart not even your skill can inform me where she is now whatever her sins are they will soon receive a more than sufficient to the man who loves art for its own sake remarked sherlock holmes tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the daily telegraph it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the watson that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little am bound to say occasionally to embellish you have given prominence not so much to the many causes clbres and sensational trials in trivial in themselves but which have given room for those faculties of the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records you have erred perhaps he observed taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherrywood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative moodyou have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friends singular character no it is not selfishness or conceit said he answering as was his art it is because it is an impersonal thinga thing beyond myself crime is common logic is rare therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell you have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at baker street a thick fog rolled down between the lines of duncoloured houses and the opposing windows loomed like dark shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal for the table had not been cleared yet sherlock holmes had been silent all the morning dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last having apparently given up his search he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings at the same time he remarked after a pause during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in a fair proportion do not endeavoured to help the king of bohemia the singular experience of miss mary sutherland the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip and the incident of the noble bachelor were all matters which are outside the pale of the law but in avoiding the sensational been novel and of interest pshaw my dear fellow what do the public the great unobservant public who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction the great cases are past man or at least criminal man has lost all enterprise and originality as to my own little practice it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and across to me should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to not inconvenience you yours faithfully that the affair of the blue carbuncle which appeared to be a mere whim case also well let us hope so but our doubts will very soon be solved for as he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room she was plainly but neatly dressed with a bright quick face freckled like a plovers egg and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world can to serve you speech of his new client he looked her over in his searching fashion and then composed himself with his lids drooping and his fingertips together to listen to her story colonel spence munro but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at halifax in nova scotia and took his children over to there is a wellknown agency for governesses in the west end called whether anything had turned up which might suit me westaway was the name of the founder of the business but it is really managed by miss stoper she sits in her own little office and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom and are then shown in one by one when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered miss stoper capital capital he seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion he was such a comfortablelooking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him you are looking for a situation miss he asked yes sir as governess yes sir and what salary do you ask oh tut tut sweatingrank sweating he cried throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion how could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and little french a little german music and drawing tut tut he cried this is all quite beside the question the point is have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country but if you have why then how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures your salary with me madam would commence at a year offer seemed almost too good to be true the gentleman however seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face opened a pocketbook and took out a note until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe great convenience and yet there was something unnatural about the quite committed myself hampshire charming rural place the copper beeches five miles on young lady and the dearest old countryhouse one childone dear little romper just six years old oh if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper smack smack smack three gone before you could wink he leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again the fathers laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking no no not the sole not the sole my dear young lady he cried obey any little commands my wife might give provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey you see no difficulty heh we might give you you would not object to our little whim heh or to sit here or sit there that would not be offensive to you oh no or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us hair is somewhat luxuriant and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut this offhand fashion fancy of my wifes and ladies fancies you know madam ladies fancies must be consulted and so you wont cut your hair the manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance handsome commission through my refusal do you desire your name to be kept upon the books she asked well really it seems rather useless since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion said she sharply you can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you was shown out by the page if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters they were at least ready to pay for their besides what use was my hair to me many people are improved by it to you the copper beeches near winchester reconsidered your decision my wife is very anxious that you should come for she has been much attracted by my description of you we are willing to give a quarter or a year so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you they are not very exacting after all my wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning you need not however go to the expense of purchasing one as we have one belonging to my dear fit you very well then as to sitting here or there or amusing yourself in any manner indicated that need cause you no inconvenience as regards your hair it is no doubt a pity for the loss your duties as far as the child is concerned are dogcart at winchester let me know your train yours faithfully jephro rucastle well miss hunter if your mind is made up that settles the question said holmes smiling but you would not advise me to refuse sister of mine apply for what is the meaning of it all mr holmes some opinion well there seems to me to be only one possible solution mr rucastle wife is a lunatic that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak that is a possible solutionin fact as matters stand it is the most probable one but in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady but the money mr holmes the money well yes of course the pay is goodtoo good that is what makes me uneasy why should they give you a year when they could have their pick for there must be some strong reason behind felt that you were at the back of me little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months there is something distinctly novel about some of danger what danger do you foresee could define it said he but at any time day or night a telegram would bring me down to your help that is enough she rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all tonight and start for winchester tomorrow with a few grateful words to holmes she bade us both goodnight and bustled off upon her stairs she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself we do not hear from her before many days are past in her direction and wondering what strange sidealley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into the unusual salary the curious conditions the light duties all pointed to something abnormal though whether a fad or a plot or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain it was quite beyond my powers to hour on end with knitted brows and an abstracted air but he swept the yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation was thinking of turning in and holmes was settling down to one of those would leave him stooping over a retort and a testtube at night and morning he opened the yellow envelope and then glancing at the message threw it across to me just look up the trains in bradshaw said he and turned back to his chemical studies the summons was a brief and urgent one please be at the black swan hotel at winchester at midday tomorrow will you come with me asked holmes glancing up just look it up then analysis of the acetones as we may need to be at our best in the by eleven oclock the next day we were well upon our way to the old english capital holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down but after we had passed the hampshire border he threw them light blue sky flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east the sun was shining very brightly and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air which set an edge to a mans energy all over the countryside away to the rolling hills around aldershot the little red and grey roofs of the farmsteadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage a man fresh from the fogs of baker street but holmes shook his head gravely do you know watson said he that it is one of the curses of a mind my own special subject you look at these scattered houses and you are comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there founded upon my experience that the lowest and vilest alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside you horrify me but the reason is very obvious the pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish there is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child or the thud of a drunkards blow does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going and there is but a step between the crime and the dock but look at these lonely houses each in its own fields filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law think of the deeds of hellish cruelty the hidden wickedness which may go on year in year out in such places and none the wiser had which makes the danger still it is clear that she is not personally quite so she has her freedom what can be the matter then can you suggest no explanation the facts as far as we know them but which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us well there is the tower of the cathedral and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has to tell the black swan is an inn of repute in the high street at no distance from the station and there we found the young lady waiting for us she had engaged a sittingroom and our lunch awaited us upon the table advice will be altogether invaluable to me pray tell us what has happened to you though he little knew for what purpose let us have everything in its due order holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen mind about them what can you not understand their reasons for their conduct but you shall have it all just as it situated but it is not beautiful in itself for it is a large square block of a house whitewashed but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather there are grounds round it woods on three sides and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the southampton highroad which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door this ground in front belongs to the house but the woods all round are part of lord southertons preserves a clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child there was no truth mr holmes in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable be a silent palefaced woman much younger than her husband not more married about seven years that he was a widower and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia mr rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother as the her position must have been uncomfortable with her fathers young wife mrs rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature she impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse she was a her husband and to her little son her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other noting every little want and forestalling it if possible he was kind to her also in his bluff boisterous fashion and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple and yet she had some secret sorrow this woman she would often be lost met so utterly spoiled and so illnatured a little creature he is small for his age with a head which is quite disproportionately large his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice creature mr holmes and indeed he has little to do with my story you to be relevant or not thing about the house which struck me at once was the appearance and conduct of the servants there are only two a man and his wife toller for that is his name is a rough uncouth man with grizzled been with them he has been quite drunk and yet mr rucastle seemed to take no notice of it his wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face as silent as mrs rucastle and much less amiable they are a nursery and my own room which are next to each other in one corner of the building for two days after my arrival at the copper beeches my life was very quiet on the third mrs rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband oh yes said he turning to me we are very much obliged to you miss hunter for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair appearance we shall now see how the electricblue dress will become you you will find it laid out upon the bed in your room and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged expressed a delight at the look of it which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence they were waiting for me in the drawingroom which is a very large room stretching along the entire front of the house with three long windows reaching down to the floor a chair had been the other side of the room began to tell me a series of the funniest has evidently no sense of humour never so much as smiled but sat with her hands in her lap and a sad anxious look upon her face after an hour or so mr rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence little edward in the nursery two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly my employer had an immense rpertoire and which he told inimitably then he handed me a yellowbacked novel and moving my chair a little sideways that my own shadow might not fall upon the page he begged me heart of a chapter and then suddenly in the middle of a sentence he ordered me to cease and to change my dress the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be they devised a means my handmirror had been broken so a happy thought up to my eyes and was able with a little management to see all that nothing at least that was my first impression at the second glance road a small bearded man in a grey suit who seemed to be looking in my direction the road is an important highway and there are usually people there this man however was leaning against the railings which handkerchief and glanced at mrs rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon was behind me she rose at once jephro said she there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at miss hunter no friend of yours miss hunter he asked dear me how very impertinent kindly turn round and motion to him to go away surely it would be better to take no notice no no we should have him loitering here always kindly turn round and wave him away like that pray continue said holmes your narrative promises to be a most interesting one me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door as we of a large animal moving about look in here said mr rucastle showing me a slit between two figure huddled up in the darkness old toller my groom is the only man who can do anything with him we feed him once a day and not too much then so that he is always as keen as mustard toller lets him loose every night and god help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon for goodness sake dont you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night for its as much as your life is worth beautiful moonlight night and the lawn in front of the house was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches as it emerged into the tawny tinted with hanging jowl black muzzle and huge projecting upon the other side that dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things there was an old chest of drawers in took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it the very first key was my coil of hair the same thickness but then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me how could my hair have been locked in the drawer with assure you that they were identical was it not extraordinary puzzle drawer which they had locked soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head there was one wing however which appeared not to be inhabited at all a door which faced that which led into the quarters of the tollers opened into his keys in his hand and a look on his face which made him a very cheeks were red his brow was all crinkled with anger and the veins stood out at his temples with passion he locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look see the windows of this part of the house there were four of them in a row three of which were simply dirty while the fourth was shuttered glancing at them occasionally mr rucastle came out to me looking as merry and jovial as ever to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there and one of them has the shutters up he looked surprised and as it seemed to me a little startled at my up there but dear me what an observant young lady we have come upon who would have believed it who would have ever believed it he spoke in a jesting tone but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at might come from my penetrating to this place they talk of womans instinct perhaps it was womans instinct which gave me that feeling chance to pass the forbidden door besides mr rucastle both toller and his wife find something to do in bag with him through the door recently he has been drinking hard and mr and mrs rucastle were both downstairs and the child was with in the lock opened the door and slipped through there was a little passage in front of me unpapered and uncarpeted which turned at a right angle at the farther end round this corner were three doors in a line the first and third of which were open they each led into an empty room dusty and cheerless with two windows in the one and one in the other so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them the centre door was closed and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall and fastened at the other with stout cord the door itself was locked as well and the key was not there this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the beneath it that the room was not in darkness evidently there was a suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door a mad unreasoning terror rose up in me at the turned and ranran as though some dreadful hand were behind me the door and straight into the arms of mr rucastle who was waiting my dear young lady my dear young ladyyou cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner wasand what has frightened you my dear young lady keenly on my guard against him out again oh it is so dreadfully still in there only that said he looking at me keenly was still smiling in the most amiable manner well then you know now and if you ever put your foot over that threshold againhere in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of to the mastiff frightened of the house of the man of the woman of the servants but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears my mind was soon to the office which is about half a mile from the house and then returned feeling very much easier a horrible doubt came into my mind that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that any influence with the savage creature or who would venture to set him for mr and mrs rucastle are going on a visit and will be away all friend rose now and paced up and down the room his hands in his pockets and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face with him that is well and the rucastles go out tonight yes the winecellar you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl miss hunter do you think that you could perform one exceptional woman the rucastles will be gone by that time and toller will we hope be you could send her into the cellar on some errand and then turn the key upon her you would facilitate matters immensely excellent we shall then look thoroughly into the affair of course there is only one feasible explanation you have been brought there to personate someone and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber have gone to america you were chosen doubtless as resembling her in height figure and the colour of your hair hers had been cut off very possibly in some illness through which she has passed and so of course yours had to be sacrificed also by a curious chance you came upon her tresses the man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of herspossibly her fiancand no doubt as you wore the girls dress and were so like her he was convinced from your laughter whenever he saw you and afterwards from your gesture that miss rucastle was perfectly happy and that she no longer desired his attentions the dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her so much is fairly clear the most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child my dear watson you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents dont you see real insight into the character of parents by studying their children this childs disposition is abnormally cruel merely for crueltys suspect or from his mother it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it oh let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor we must be circumspect for we are dealing with a very cunning man we can do nothing until seven oclock at that hour we shall be with you and it will not be long before we solve the mystery we were as good as our word for it was just seven when we reached the copper beeches having put up our trap at a wayside publichouse the group of trees with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun were sufficient to mark the house even had miss hunter not been standing smiling on the doorstep have you managed it asked holmes a loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs that is mrs toller in the cellar said she her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug here are his keys which are the duplicates of mr you have done well indeed cried holmes with enthusiasm now lead the way and we shall soon see the end of this black business we passed up the stair unlocked the door followed on down a passage and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar then he tried the various keys in the lock but without success no sound came from within and at the silence holmes face clouded over that we had better go in without you now watson put your shoulder to it and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in save a little pallet bed a small table and a basketful of linen the skylight above was open and the prisoner gone there has been some villainy here said holmes this beauty has guessed miss hunters intentions and has carried his victim off but how through the skylight we shall soon see how he managed it he swung himself up onto the roof ah yes he cried heres the end of a long light ladder against the eaves that is how he did it but it is impossible said miss hunter the ladder was not there when the rucastles went away as well for you to have your pistol ready the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room a very fat and burly man with a heavy stick in his hand miss hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him you villain said he wheres your daughter the fat man cast his eyes round and then up at the open skylight you he turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go hes gone for the dog cried miss hunter better close the front door cried holmes and we all rushed down the stairs together we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound and then a scream of agony with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door two days quick quick or itll be too late hurrying behind us there was the huge famished brute its black muzzle buried in rucastles throat while he writhed and screamed upon the keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck with much labour we separated them and carried him living but horribly mangled into the house we laid him upon the drawingroom sofa and when the door opened and a tall gaunt woman entered the room mrs toller cried miss hunter yes miss mr rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you ah miss it is a pity you didnt let me know what you were knows more about this matter than anyone else then pray sit down and let us hear it for there are several points she was never happy at home miss alice wasnt from the time that her father married again she was slighted like and had no say in anything but it never really became bad for her until after she met mr fowler her own by will but she was so quiet and patient she was that she never said a word about them but just left everything in mr rucastles hands he knew he was safe with her but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward who would ask for all that the law would give him then her father thought it time to put a stop on it he wanted her to sign a paper so that whether she married or not he could use her money when she wouldnt do it he kept on worrying her until she got brainfever and for six weeks was at deaths door then she got better at last all worn to a shadow and with her beautiful hair cut off but that didnt make no change in her young man and he stuck to her as true as man could be yes sir and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of mr fowler that was it sir but mr fowler being a persevering man as a good seaman should be blockaded the house and having met you succeeded by certain arguments metallic or otherwise in convincing you that your interests were the same as his mr fowler was a very kindspoken freehanded gentleman said mrs toller serenely and in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out you have it sir just as it happened have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us and here comes best escort miss hunter back to winchester as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one and thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door mr rucastle survived but was always a broken man kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife they still live with their old servants who probably know so much of rucastles past life that he finds it difficult to part from them mr fowler and miss rucastle were married by special license in southampton the day after their flight and he is now the holder of a hunter my friend holmes rather to my disappointment manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems and she is now the head of a private school at end of the project gutenberg ebook of the adventures of sherlock holmes by arthur conan doyle this file should be named txt or zip
